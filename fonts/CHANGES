The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  the BDF format has been adopted as a non-exclusive, required
	part of the X standard; server vendors should provide a way of
	converting BDF files into whatever format their server requires.
     o  the font compiler and its directory have been renamed bdftosnf since
	there are other formats that will need compilers.
     o  a new utility, mkfontdir, has been added for creating the appropriate
	font name databases for a given directory; some of the routines in
	this directory are also used in the sample server.
     o  the separate snf directory has been removed in favor of compiling
	directly into the bdf directories.
