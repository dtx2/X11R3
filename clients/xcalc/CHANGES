The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  reverse video bugs have been fixed.
     o  added -fg and -bg.
     o  unfortunately, hp mode is still very broken.


This application should be split into widgets for each of the different 
styles of calculator.  It is currently almost unmaintainable.
