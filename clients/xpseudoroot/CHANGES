This is a new utility for R3.  However, it is only a prototype and is subject
to change without notice.  The ICCCM pseudoroot interfaces that it uses are 
experimental and no attempt will be made to maintain compatibility should
changes be required.  This program is provided primarily for people wishing
to explore how pseudoroots might be used.
