 * This is experimental code for implementing pseudo-root windows as specified
 * by the Inter-Client Communications Conventions Manual.  The interfaces that
 * it provides should be considered private to the MIT implementation of Xlib
 * and are SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.  They should not be incorporated
 * into any toolkits or applications.  When they change, no effort will be
 * made to provide backwards compatibility.
 *
 * Current questions about the implementation are delimited by triple X's.
 *
 * If you think this all sounds severe, you're right.  In fact, we have to
 * reach into the Xlib directory to get the source file specifically to 
 * discourage people from building toolkits or applications on this stuff.
