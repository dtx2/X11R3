The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o	many bugs have been fixed.
     o	a default initial geometry is now set in app-defaults/Xmh so
	first-time users are treated a little nicer.
     o	a new option, ReplyInsertFilter, has been added to allow easy
	incorporation of the text of the message being replied to.
     o	the application cursor is now a resource.
     o	wordWrap mode is now used in all message windows.
