This directory has been moved from contrib/ in R2.

Here is the list of changes to xman.  Unresolved bug fixes and
neat features are listed in the TODO file.

I have changed this in to reverse chronological order to make it
easier to read.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1  -> 3.1.1
------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes.

1) Manual Pages now handle text properly if partially obscured.

2) Manual Pages smaller than one screen do not cause xman to die.

3) Command line arguments and resources work properly again.

4) Scrollbars on man pages and directories are the same size by default.

5) Better handling of the decision to boldify.

6) Searching with multiple manual pages visable now works correctly.

7) Resources are all in a structure, so that machines with the MSB set
   on pointers will do the right thing.  
   THANKS TO: Martin Streicher

8) Default width, is no longer dependant on the width of the display,
   but is set with #define DEFAULT_WIDTH in defs.h.  Problems may still
   occur with displays that are not 75 dpi.

   a) xman knows about "mano" by default now.

10) Right button paging in manual pages works correctly on all machines.

    comes up correctly in the center of the manual page.

13) Reverse video works correctly.

14) AproposFilter now uses "man -k" rather than "apropos"
    THANKS TO:  Arthur David Olson.

15) When searching for manual pages, highlight now reflects current 
    manual page.

   THANKS TO: clyde@rutgers.edu

   latest man page for details.

3) Warning messages printed to manual page window as well as stdout.

    size is used.

	b) 	prompt changed to:  "Type string to search for"
	c)      Remove auto popdown feature of this window.

2)      Corrected typo in Xman Options menu: "Open New . . ."

3)      Returned default to horizontal scrolling.

4)      Remember the previous state when going to "Show Both Screens"
	and return there when show one screen.

5)      Menus changed to Override Redirect due to popular demand, and
	too many confused window managers.

6)      Help File Proof read.

7)      Descenders no longer get chopped in manual page display.

9) 	Help File Display Changes.

		display.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0 (X11R2 Tape) -> Version 3.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Features:

1) Startup time is now 3 times faster.

2) Manual page searches now SCREAM, speed MUCH improved.

3) -pagesize argument added and documented in manual page.

4) List widget used for directory, may new features of directory
   a) vertical or horizontal orientation via the "verticalList" resource
      vertical is now the default.
      e.g  xman*verticalList:        False

    b) current manual page is highlighted in the directory listing.
    c) resizing the window now creates more columns in directory 
       (see bug fix #4).
    d) Pixmaps no longer created for each directory listing.
       you people with color workstations should like this one.

5) Xman no longer uses the window widget, and it has been removed from
   the distribution.  If you want a copy send me e-mail.

Bug Fixes:

1) The height of the directory items was wrong if a different
   font is used for the directory than for the manual pages.

2) The topBox resource for the initial "Manual Browser" box now 
   can be specified.  This allows the geometry of this box to be 
   set with resources.

   e.g xman*topBox.geometry:      =100x100+2+2

3) Xman now handles the case of no help file correctly.

4) Resizing the directory now causes the columns to fill in the new area.
   This causes more of the directory to be visable in wider windows, and
   resizing narrower does not lose information.


Know bugs yet to be resolved:

1) Resizing the man page causes the directory to grow too big.
   and the manpage to get real small. (1 pixel).
