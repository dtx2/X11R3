BUGS:

    Something weird is going on when xman*topBox.iconic is TRUE.  The icon
    appears under the mouse pointer, not in the geometry spec location
    (geometry specified with xman*topBox.iconGeometry).
    Also, specifying xman*manualBrowser.iconGeometry does the same thing
    when iconifying the browser window.

    resising the vpane does not work correctly.

    manpages in mutilple directories may not actually appear in 
    the order presented by the manpath.

NEAT FEATURES:

**   I miss the x10 behaviour of putting a box arround
   the currently pointed at man page when you're wandering around the
   directory.  I think you got valuable feedback that way. 

   How about a "print this manpage" command that would confirm the
   printer choice and go do a psroff -man? 

   It would be nice if "help" told you about the
   Xresources used by xman (like xman*topBox.geometry) ...

   show message when formatting manpage.

   Handle Compressed manual pages, by page and by directory.

   Implement searches within manpages.

   Redo menus.

   Get a more user friendly scrollbar.

   Save Under/ Backing Store.

   Many man pages have a SEE ALSO section at the end.  It would be nice
   if you could parse those, and put up buttons that the user can click
   on to select one of those pages without having to switch sections and
   then pick the manpage.
   

** This needs to be added to the Athena List Widget.
