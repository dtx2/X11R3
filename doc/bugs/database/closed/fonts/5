Glenn,

I have always understood that glyphs was the intent.  A properly
constructed font with no unnecessary padding of zeros would produce
the "correct" metrics within the server.  As Robert has noted, the intent
is clear from the definition of the data structure and hinted at in
bdf diagrams in Adobe documentation.

What may be confusing to understand is, depending on how the font is
implemented, the metrics in the sample server actually define the metrics
of the bitmap and not the the visable glyph.  This "incorrect" set of metrics 
"sometimes" result in accelerators that speed the text operations.  The 
terminalFont member of FontInfoRec was one example of such an accelerator
that Robert refered to.  

These and other accelerators could exist, and be based on the extent of
the bitmap, while still allowing the character metrics to be defined
(and calculated) correctly as the extent of the visable glyph.

As Robert has said, he and MIT knows that the fonts and font compiler
in X11 is broken in that it does not calculate character metrics based on the
visible glyphs but instead uses only the extent of the bitmap to calculate
the character metrics.  This only produces correct metrics when the font 
uses bitmaps that are the smallest possible bitmap containing the visable glyph.
Many of the fonts distributed with X11 do not do this.

Since Robert has sited it as a bug, I won't send another bug report on it
since I assume they have noted it.  Later we may want to schedule time to
fix the font compiler, offering "correct" metric calculations and 
accelerators based on bitmap extents as well as visable glyph extents.
We could offer this as a possible bug fix that would be worth sending to
MIT.  Currently this is low priority compared to our local server
implementation.

Paul
