Subject: sun fonts versus Xfonts

### bug number:   128
### area:         fonts
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

in x10v4, sun fonts in /usr/lib/fonts/fixedwidthfonts were acceptable
to -fn args in x clients. No longer in x11. Is there a conversion tool?
The x11 font repetoire is pretty meagre.
