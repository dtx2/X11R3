Subject:        "Variable" font bug?

### bug number:   590
### area:         fonts
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	BellTech 386

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	AT&T Unix System V Release 3

DISPLAY:
	EGA

SYNOPSIS:
	 "Variable" font has zero width spaces.

DESCRIPTION:
	 Perhaps a zero width space is intended, but it looks pretty funny
	 when bitmap uses it in its dialog boxes and buttons.  Especially in
	 the dialog boxes, sentences with no spaces between the words is a
	 bit hard to read.

REPEAT-BY:
	Make sure your server has the "variable" font.  Run bitmap, modify
	the bitmap, push the Quit button.  A dialog box will pop up containing
	a question with no spaces in it.

FIX:
	If a zero width space was intended for some typographical reason,
	then perhaps bitmap shouldn't use "variable" as its default font.
