### bug number:   333
### area:         xset
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     user can use xset q | egrep '^Font Path:' | 
###		  	       sed 's/^Font Path:[ 	]*//'


in X11R2, command xset:

I suggest that it be valid to write:

xset fp /foo/bar/myfonts,default

to create a path that includes the default path without knowing what
it is. At very least, a command which prints the default path on
stdout would enable this
