### bug number:   310
### area:         CLX
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

Shouldn't the CLX function copy-area do a force-gcontext-changes?  Perhaps
as part of the with-buffer-request?  If I do a with-gcontext and then call
force-gcontext-changes by hand then I get the proper behaviour.  I'm running
under Lucid 2.1.1 on a Sun 3/160 in X.V11R2.

Also, does changing cursors work as advertised?  I'm working on a "Generic
Windows" port for X11 (Generic Windows is Schlumberger's common windows
look alike.)  No matter what I do I always get a cursor that is a solid
black square the size of the cursor mask.

Thanks.

								Malcolm
