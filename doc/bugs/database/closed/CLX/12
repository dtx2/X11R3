### bug number:   103
### area:         CLX
### severity:     
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       closed


I've managed to get CLX running under CMU Common Lisp using the Mach
operating system.

Just as Sandra did, I also had problems compiling CLX because of unquoted
uses of the "#." read-macro and occurrences of "#()".  (Vectors aren't
required to be self-evaluating according to Steele.)

Specifically,

CLX.LISP:  The "#()" in the event-extensions slot of the display defstruct.

MACROS.LISP:  The define-accessors for member, member8, and member16
weren't getting expanded correctly.  My fix was to quote each occurrence
of ",(apply #'vector mumble)".  There are 9 of those, I think.  I'm not
really sure whether this is the right thing to do, but it seems to work.

(You've probably already fixed this next one, LaMott.)

IMAGE.LISP:  The "#()" forms used to initialize the data slot of the
image-x defstruct and the pixarray slot of the image-y defstruct.  The
"#.(coerce" form in the byte-reverse function.

One more problem is that the "ignore" function called in allocate-event in
the file INPUT.LISP is not standard Common Lisp.  I just changed this to an
ignore declaration instead.
