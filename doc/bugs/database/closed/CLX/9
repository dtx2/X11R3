Regarding the message below:  The bug in create-glyph-cursor didn't get
fixed in release 2, while the bug in rgb-val->card16 did.  Did this fall
through the cracks?

I discovered a couple more problems with CLX under Lucid. 

First the easy one.  In create-glyph-cursor there is a call to pixmap-display
that needed to be changed to font-display.

In dependent.lisp the function rgb-val->card16 does a truncate and specifies
the type of the result using (the card16 ..).  This construct breaks under
Lucid (2.1.1) because truncate returns multiple values.  One easy fix to
the problem was to apply the identity function to the result of truncate.
I remember JonL talking about this problem on the common-lisp mailing list
but I don't remember what he decided.

So, am I rediscovering the wheel?
