    (xlib:draw-rectangle window gcontext 10 10 100 30 t)

    Then

    (xlib:draw-rectangle window gcontext 10 10 100 30)

    The *non-filled* rectangle is one pixel larger on the right and bottom than
    the filled rectangle.

Correct.  To understand why, read the protocol document, under CreateGC,
PolyRectangle, and PolyFillRectangle.

    Interestingly this doesn't seem to happen for white on black windows.

I don't have a Sun display handy, but I can't reproduce this on other
servers.  If you are sure this is true of a V11R2 server, then please
submit a new bug report indicating specifics (e.g., OS and display
hardware).
