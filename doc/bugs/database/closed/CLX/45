with-gcontext doesn't work right on non lisp machines when cache-p is t.

(it works ok when cache-p is nil)

Repeat by:
(with-gcontext (gc :function boole-c2) (foo))

then later using gc without a (with-gcontext) wrapper -- function will
still be set to boole-c2 on the server side, but (gcontext-function gc)
will return boole-1 to lisp.

The problem should be in with-gcontext-bindings for non lispm, but I'm not
really sure what it's doing so I can give a fix.
Why is the lispm with-gcontext-bindings different from the nonlispm, anyway?
