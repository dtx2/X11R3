### bug number:   680
### area:         CLX
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	any

WINDOW MANAGER:
	any

AREA:
	CLX

SYNOPSIS:
	CLX should always write-through resources in gcontexts

DESCRIPTION:
	CLX optimizes out (re)setting a tile, stipple, or clip-mask
	to an identical resource id.  This is a bug (that has been
	fixed in the C Xlib).  The problem is that the client may
	have written into the pixmap in the interim, and may be
	re-storing into the gcontext to have the new contents take effect,
	because the protocol allows the server to copy the pixmap contents
	at the time of the store, rather than continuing to share with the
	pixmap.

REPEAT-BY:
	eyeball

FILES:
	lib/CLX/gcontext.l

FIX:
	???
