I'm running SunOS 3.4 on a Sun 3/50.  I just built and installed
X.V11R2 and have discovered the same problem that I had with version 1
-- I can't start up X when my login shell is ksh.

When I run xinit, I get the message about waiting for the server to
start, followed by an continuing line of dots.  A ps shows the X server
running, but the characteristic root window never shows up.  If I
switch to the csh or Bourne shell and log in again, everything behaves
just fine and starts up properly.

I don't have the time, energy, or patience to try to track this down
right now.  Has anyone out there seen the same problem?  Got any fixes
or suggestions to pass along?  I'd love to switch to X from Sunwindows,
but I refuse to switch from ksh at this point!

Thanks in advance!
