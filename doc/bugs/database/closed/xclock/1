Subject: get clock widget width fails

### bug number:   408
### area:         xclock
### severity:     medium high
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	sunos 3.5

DISPLAY:
	sun 3/50 bwtwo

SYNOPSIS:
	clock widget dumps core when you try to get its width.

DESCRIPTION:
	clock widget dumps core when you try to get its width.

REPEAT-BY:

# include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
# include <X11/StringDefs.h>
# include <X11/Form.h>
# include <X11/Clock.h>
# include <stdio.h>

main(argc, argv)
	char		*argv;
{
	Widget	top_level;
	Widget	top_form;
	Widget	clock;
	Arg	arg;

	top_level = XtInitialize(NULL, "xgadget", 0, 0, &argc, argv );
	if (argc != 1)
		syntax();

	top_form = XtCreateManagedWidget("topForm", formWidgetClass, top_level,
					 (ArgList) NULL, 0);

	clock = XtCreateManagedWidget("clock", clockWidgetClass, top_form,
				      (ArgList) NULL, 0);

	XtRealizeWidget(top_level);

	XtSetArg(arg, XtNwidth, 0);
	XtGetValues(clock, &arg, 1);

	XtMainLoop();
}

syntax() {
	fprintf(stderr, "usage: xgadget\n");
	exit(1);
}


FIX:
	xt needs a validation suite, or some sort of exerciser to flog
	widgets with.
