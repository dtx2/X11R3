VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50, Gould PN, Gould NP, VAX 11/750

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Sun UNIX 4.2, UTX 2.1, UTX 3.0,  4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	Sun 3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	xclock update period automagically decreases

DESCRIPTION:
	The Clock widget has a bug that causes the update period to decrease
	everytime the widget's Redisplay routine is called.

REPEAT-BY:
	To reproduce the bug set your clock to update every few seconds,
	and then open and close the clock window a few times.

FIX:
	
	The bug is in  Xaw/Clock.c  in the  "clock_tic" procedure.  The 
	"Redisplay" code passes a NULL id pointer when it calls "clock_tic"
	but "clock_tic does not check for a NULL id.  The fix is to add the
	lines marked (with !):
 
	!    if (id) {              
		w->clock.interval_id =
		    XtAddTimeOut( w->clock.update*1000, clock_tic, (caddr_t)w );
	!    }
