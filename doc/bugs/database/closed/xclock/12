VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 4/110

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2

DISPLAY:
	BW

SYNOPSIS:
	If one manages to expose part of the Clock widget just as
	the minute changes, the old hands are not erased.

DESCRIPTION:
	Xclock, using the Clock widget in analog mode, occasionally
	leaves the window in a strange state, with an old copy of the
	minute hand visible (this could be true for the second hand as
	well, but I don't use it).  If you partially cover the Clock
	window, and then expose it, if the minute has changed since the
	last time the Clock was updated, the widget doesn't erase the
	old hands before redrawing the window, leaving junk in the
	window.

REPEAT-BY:
	- run xclock
	- run something else (an xterm will do), and partially
	  cover the xclock window, leave the hands visible.
	- wait a while (this is a timing dependent bug, so it's
	  a little hard to reproduce), until the minute changes,
	  but before xclock redraws the window
	- Raise the xclock window

	Notice at this point that the old minute hand is still
	visible.

FIX:
	This fix is a bit of a kludge.  It just fully erases
	the Clock window before redrawing the analog hands
	and face.
