Comment:		These are long standing bugs, which probably
			won't go away until X11R3 or R4. However, they
			won't get fixed if they don't get mentioned.
What's wrong:

Two bugs:
1) When you hit ^U in an icon, the text is deleted, and the cursor is
warped to the center of the window, which is one space wide; then the
icon shrinks to a very narrow width, leaving the cursor outside of it.

2) While typing into an icon, the mouse is rewarped to be at the
center of the icon; if the icon is not at the top of the stack, it may
disappear under another window, and the mouse can get warped into the
window, instead of staying with the icon.

What should have happened:

1) Since it is warping, it should get it right, and keep it inside the
icon.

2) Several solutions are possible: not warping, grabbing the input
focus until user moves the mouse out of the window (difficult :-),
always raising the icon while typing into it.
