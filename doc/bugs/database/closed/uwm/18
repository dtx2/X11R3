Subject: local may be used before set in uwm.c

### bug number:   524
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     



VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	amiga 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	amigados

DISPLAY:
	amiga

SYNOPSIS:
	uninitialized variable being used "Bool local;"

DESCRIPTION:
	The local variable 'local' declared in main is not given an
	initial value. If you do not specify any options on the control
	line for uwm local is never set and is apparently assumed to
	contain NULL. This is not true though.  This may cause uwm
	to start up thinking it is in local mode when it is not.
	This behavior is dependant on whatever the stack happens to be set
	to when this program starts up.

REPEAT-BY:
	uwm

FIX:
89c89
<     Bool local;			/* If true, then do not use system defaults. */
---
>     Bool local = FALSE;		/* If true, then do not use system defaults. */
