Subject: problem with window creation user interface
Play-Safe: it could save your life

### bug number:   790
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

An application asked me to open a window with the name in the
upper-left corner of the screen and the pointer changed to a
corner-shape.  But as soon as this started, another application (a
zephyr windowgram) put a window up in the upper-left corner, covering
the prompt for the window I was creating.

I needed to see the window creation prompt to be sure I was setting up
the new window correctly, but there was no way to see it.  I couldn't
move the window covering it, since the mouse was captured by the
window creation.  

Can the uwm (or whatever handles the creation) detect another window
covering this prompt, and pop the prompting window back to the top?
