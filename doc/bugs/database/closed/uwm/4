VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	You must specify a height, width, x and y for uwm to place an
	application.
DESCRIPTION:
	If an application is given the string '=+15+15', uwm goes
	ahead and asks for a position rather than placing the application
	at 15,15 and using the default height and width.
REPEAT-BY:
	bitmap junk =+15+15
