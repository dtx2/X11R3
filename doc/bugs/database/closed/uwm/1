Subject: UWM perhaps a bug

### bug number:   118
### area:         uwm
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     see the response at the bottom

wm has the very helpful property of maintaining window labels. However,
wm is documented as the un-preferred window manager. uwm, conversly,
appears to be the blessed window manager, but dosen't maintain window labels.

A person might consider it a bug.

A person might not.

Is there a X-group party line on this issue? I understood that the X11
theory was that labels were the window manager's department. Is
there going to be an `official' window manager that implements this?
If I ported the wm label code to uwm, would you accept it ?

 The problem is that wm is really a hack.  Uwm, although kind of ugly, is a 
 lot closer to being something usable.  A number of other window managers are
 being written by various people (some commercial, some public including cwm
 in the andrew sources) that support title bars.  Jordan Hubbard has been
 rewriting uwm, but we haven't heard from him lately.

 Anyone is welcome to submit code.  It should be selectable from the .uwmrc
 file as well as from a new f. function.  Dealing with reparenting might be 
 harder than it looks, however.
