VERSION: X11 release 2
CLIENT MACHINE: Sun 3/110
CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM: Sun OS 3.2 (?)
DISPLAY:
SYNOPSIS: doesn't work
DESCRIPTION: setting the input focus with f.focus in uwm doesn't work
REPEAT-BY: put the following line into your .uwmrc and run uwm
f.focus=	m|s	: w|r	: left down
Hitting m|s-left on a window will not set the input focus.
RANDOM REMARK: attempting to set the input focus on an xterm
does cause it not to change the color of the window border
anymore.
RANDOM REMARK: I reported this bug a while back probably for
release 1, and the problem was indeed that XSetInputFocus didn't
work, rather than some problem specific to uwm.
