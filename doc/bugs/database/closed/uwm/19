### bug number:   550
### area:         uwm
### severity:     high
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 4.0

DISPLAY:
	/dev/fb

SYNOPSIS:
	uwm crashes if a window has a null name

DESCRIPTION:
	If a window is explicitly titled with a name which is a NULL
	pointer, then uwm crashes while querying the user for a position.
	The crash is due to attempting to dereference a null pointer
	in the strlen call at line 134 of RubberBand.c

FIX: diff RubberBand.c{.orig,}
