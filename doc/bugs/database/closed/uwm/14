### bug number:   429
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	uwm can potentially bomb if sizing hints flag set incorrectly.
DESCRIPTION:
	If a client program sets the sizing hints flag to PAllHints but
	does not initialize the elements or sets an element to zero,
	uwm can potentially bomb. Below is a suggested fix if the width_inc
	and/or height_inc elements of the sizing hints are zero. If either
	of these are zero, uwm causes a floating point execption and core
	dumps.

	Consideration needs to be made about inappropriate values for other
	elements.
REPEAT-BY:
	Set the flag in the sizing hints to PAllHints, but neglect to set
	width_inc or height_inc.
SUGGESTED FIX:
