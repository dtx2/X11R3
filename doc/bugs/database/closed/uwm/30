Subject: XCreateWindow vs. XSetNormalHints

### bug number:   809
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	VS2000, Athena 4.3BSD release 6.0B

DISPLAY:
	VS2000 sm display

WINDOW MANAGER:
	uwm

AREA:
	Xlib, uwm(?)

SYNOPSIS:
	XCreateWindow args are used when instead of Normal SizeHints
when USPosition is set.

DESCRIPTION:
	User specified position (registered with XSetNormalHints)
causes uwm to map the window without user intervention. However, it
maps it to the position and size specified by XCreateWindow, not the
actual value of the hints.
	

REPEAT BY:
        Using the Saber C Interpreter, I was able to demonstrate the
problem very clearly:

	Then, examining the window, it is clear that the arguments to
XCreateWindow are being obeyed while those to XSetNormalHints are not.
Note that the window did appear without user intervention.

FIX:
	No clue, I haven't really looked. A lot of programs seem not
to have this problem, since they do the create with the values given
by the user; I discovered this trying to debug a problem reported with
the -geometry option to x11r3dvi.
