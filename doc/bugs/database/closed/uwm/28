Subject:        Uwm bug

### bug number:   589
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	BellTech 386

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	AT&T Unix System V Release 3

DISPLAY:
	EGA

SYNOPSIS:
	 Uwm - icon text can get eaten due to the icon window not being
	 refreshed at times.

DESCRIPTION:
	Moving a text icon that was partially obscured by a uwm menu eats
	some of the icon text.

REPEAT-BY:
	 Situation: running uwm and have a text icon created by uwm for the
	 client because it didn't offer an icon hint.  Now bring up a uwm menu
	 containing the move operation.  Bring up the menu such that it
	 will partially obscure the icon, leaving enough of the icon to be
	 able to move the icon window, but covering some of the icon's text.
	 Select move from the uwm menu and move the icon.

	 You'll see that the portion of the icon that was covered by the menu
	 is not refreshed.  Only the move operation has this problem.  Move
	 opaque doesn't even have it.  Also clients that supplied a bitmap
	 for the icon do not have this problem.  Also it only happens for icons
	 that were obscured by the menu.  Icons obscured by any other window and
	 then moved do not have this problem.

FIX:
	Don't know.  However, it would be nice if the menu disappeared
	immediately after you selected from it, instead of staying up until
	you start the operation.  That way you could bring up the menu over
	a window and still ba able to operate on that window even if it was
	completely obscured by the menu.  This would have the side effect of
	simply avoiding the situation where the bug occurs.
