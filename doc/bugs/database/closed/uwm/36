[This should probably go on to the X consortium]

System type, version:	(VS2) Version 6.0R
System name:		lycus
What's wrong:

When the f.restart function is invoked (e.g. via a menu), uwm destroys
its currently mapped icons and maps all the windows to the place they
were before iconifying.  In the case of xterm and emacs windows,
however, it seems to miss a bit.  It leaves the windows misplaced by
(1,1) from the former position.

This value (1,1) may be related to borderwidth, but I haven't investigated.

The effect seems to be cumulative.  If you iconify, restart, iconify,
restart, then your windows are displaced by (2,2).

What should have happened:

When it remaps everything it shouldn't misplace them.
