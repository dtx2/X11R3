VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	uwm variable 'autoselect' does not work.
DESCRIPTION:
	Documentation states that with 'autoselect' in a uwm file,
	when a menu is activated, the cursor will be placed on the
	first entry below the header. This was not working. It did
	not matter whether or not 'autoselect' or 'noautoselect' was
	in the startup file. The cursor was always placed on the header
	when a menu was activated.
REPEAT-BY:
	Placed 'autoselect' in my startup file.
FIX:
