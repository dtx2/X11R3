VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

SYNOPSIS:
	f.resize has an unnatural user interface

DESCRIPTION:
	When using f.resize, my recollection of X10 is that the
	initial mouse position did not indicate the starting
	position for the new window corner/side, but instead was
	used as	a relative offset from the current corner/side
	position.  Did this behaviour change in R1 or R2, and is
	it desirable?  My natural tendency (which means it must
	have been true in X10 :-) when trying to add a line or
	column or two is to just click somewhere in the vicinity
	and pull over just a little bit, but this usually ends
	up making the window smaller, rather than larger.
