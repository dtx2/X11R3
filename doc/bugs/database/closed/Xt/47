### bug number:   872
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     fixed in R3; ObjectDestroy frees all callback lists.


VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	CoreDestroy() should free up the memory occupied by the
        widget's destroy callback list.

DESCRIPTION:
        The CoreDestroy() routine fails to free up the memory occupied
        by a widget's destroy callback list, thus causing a memory leak.

REPEAT BY:
        Write a program which creates a bunch of widgets, and then adds
        destroy callbacks to each widget; then destroy the widgets.
        (Have the program repeat this several times). 

FIX:

/* The following is a patch to Core.c */

291a300,303
> 
>     /* Remove the destroy_callbacks list */
>     XtRemoveAllCallbacks(widget, XtNdestroyCallback);
