### bug number:   416
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
        X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60.  I don't think it matters.

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4.  I don't think this matters either.

DISPLAY:
	CG4.  This should also not matter.

SYNOPSIS:
	This is a documentation error in the Toolkit.

DESCRIPTION:
	In section 10.1.1 of "X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language X Interface",
	Input callbacks are declared as follows:

		void InputCallbackProc(client_data, source, id)
		caddr_t client_data;
		int source;
		XtInputId id;

		client data	Specifies the client data that was registered
				for this procedure in XtAddInput.

		source		Specifies the source file descriptor generating
				the event.

		id		Specifies the ID returned from the correspond-
				ing XtAddInput call.

	However, in lib/Xt/NextEvent.c, 1.40 88/02/26 12:43:29 swick, line 274,
	IeCallProc reads as follows:

		static void
		IeCallProc(ptr)
		struct InputEvent *ptr;
		{
		  (* (ptr->ie_proc))( ptr->ie_closure, &ptr->ie_source, &ptr);
		}

	Note that the second of the three arguments are passed by _reference_
	rather than by _value_.  Experimentation shows, in fact, that if one
	wishes to see the source file descriptor or the XtInputId, one must
	declare one's input callback routines such that they expect their
	second two arguments to be passed by reference.

REPEAT-BY:
	Examine the manual and the code.

FIX:
	I would prefer that the manual change (rather than the IeCallBack()
	source), since my client now has code in production that depends on
	the present definition of the Input Callback functions.  Also, I feel
	that passing these arguments by reference would allow the 'source' to
	be something other than a file descriptor, which could be valuable in
	the future.
