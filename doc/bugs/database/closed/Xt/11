Subject: Shell destroy bug in Toolkit
--------

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110C

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	Shell widgets are not removed from the parents popup list correctly.

DESCRIPTION:
Found the following bug in popups.  Application is bringing up a popup-form,
when the user selects a QUIT button a popup-confirmer asks the user to verify.
The confirmer is popped-down and destroyed then the form is popped-down and
destroyed.  The error message:
     XtWarning("ShellDestroy, widget not on parent popup list");
appears.

It looks like the ShellDestroy routine is always removing 
widget->core.popup_list[0], whenever a popup is destroyed.

Also, when you are copying the popups (in the following code)
    for (i=0;i<parent->core.num_popups-1;i++)
        parent->core.popup_list[i]= parent->core.popup_list[i+1];

the loop should go from the widget destroyed to (num_popups - 2).
Otherwise the final widget on the list is garbage (potential core dump to
follow).


REPEAT-BY:
	Create two overrideShellWidgets, popup first, popup second,
	popdown second, popdown first.

FIX:
static void ShellDestroy(widget)
    Widget  widget;
{
    int i;
    Boolean found = FALSE;
    register Widget parent;
    parent = widget->core.parent;
*   int which;

    if (parent == NULL | parent->core.being_destroyed) return;
    for (i=0;i<=parent->core.num_popups-1;i++)
        if (parent->core.popup_list[i] == widget){
            found = TRUE; 
	    which = i;
	     break;
        }
    if (found == FALSE) {
        XtWarning("ShellDestroy, widget not on parent popup list");
        return;
    }
    for (i=which;i<parent->core.num_popups-2;i++)
        parent->core.popup_list[i]= parent->core.popup_list[i+1];
    parent->core.num_popups--;
}
