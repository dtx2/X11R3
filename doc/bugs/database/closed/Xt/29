Subject: input source callback args don't match doc

### bug number:   406
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160C or 3/75M

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or Sprite (Berkeley experimental)

DISPLAY:
	cg2 or bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	The toolkit intrinsics document says the 'source' argument to an
	InputCallbackProc (as called when a source specified by
	XtAddInput is ready) is passed by value, when it is actually passed by
	reference.

REPEAT-BY:
	Believe the doc and try to read from that file...

FIX:
	Fix the doc.
