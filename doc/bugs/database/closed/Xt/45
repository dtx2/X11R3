### bug number:   531
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	XtTranslateCoords() is useless if used in conjunction with a
        reparenting window manager

DESCRIPTION:
	XtTranslateCoords() makes the assumption that the shell coordinates
        are always relative to the root window.  Unfortunately, when using
        a reparenting window manager, this assumption is invalid.
