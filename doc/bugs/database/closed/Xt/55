### bug number:   657
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     Is this obviously a compiler bug?

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 Xaw

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 4.0

DISPLAY:
	Sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	 XtOffset macro gives incorrect offset

DESCRIPTION:
	 On the Cray-XMP and Cray2 compilers, the XtOffset macro
gives a word offset instead of a byte offset of a field in a structure.
Although there is a problem in the Cray compiler that  these offsets
cannot be determined at compile time, the macro itself seems to
assume byte addressability, which is not true of a Cray.  So,

#define XtOffset(type,field)    ((unsigned int)&(((type)NULL)->field))

yields a word offset.

REPEAT-BY:
	Compile any of the widgets in the Xaw library.

FIX:
	Calculate the offsets at run time (class_initialize routine)
	with a different macro:

<     XtResourceList resp = resources;
<     resp++->resource_offset = BoxOffset(box.h_space);
<     resp++->resource_offset = BoxOffset(box.v_space);
< }
< #endif
