Subject:  XtNextEvent nil pointer bug in timer handling

### bug number:   399

### severity:     high

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110C

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	XtNextEvent seg. faults when there are items in the TimerQueue

DESCRIPTION:
	A loop which traverses the timer queue does not check for the end the
	timer list.  Code is:

        if (TimerQueue != NULL) {
	    while (IS_AFTER (TimerQueue->te_timer_value, cur_time))) {
                        te_ptr = TimerQueue;
                        TimerQueue = TimerQueue->te_next;
                        te_ptr->te_next = NULL;
                        TeCallProc(te_ptr);
                        XtFree((char*)te_ptr);
	    }
	}

If there is only one item in the timer queue and it expires, the second time
through the loop TimerQueue will be NULL and cause a core dump.

REPEAT-BY:
	

FIX:
        while (TimerQueue &&
                (IS_AFTER (TimerQueue->te_timer_value, cur_time))) {
                        te_ptr = TimerQueue;
                        TimerQueue = TimerQueue->te_next;
                        te_ptr->te_next = NULL;
                        TeCallProc(te_ptr);
                        XtFree((char*)te_ptr);
        }
