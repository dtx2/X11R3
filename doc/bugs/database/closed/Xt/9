VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
        Attempting to modify the 'mapped_when_managed' flag using
        XtSetValues() does not work

DESCRIPTION:
	When using XtSetValues() to modify the state of the 
        'mapped_when_managed' flag for a widget, the Core's set values
        routine invokes XtSetMappedWhenManaged(), but passes in the
        wrong widget Id.  

        XtSetMappedWhenManaged() takes two parameters:

           a widget Id
           the new setting for the mapped_when_managed flag

        One of the first things XtSetMappedWhenManaged() does is to verify
        that the new setting is different than the current setting in the
        widget; if they are the same, then it returns without doing anything.

        When the Core's set values routine invokes XtSetMappedWhenManaged(),
        it passes 'new' as the widget Id, and 'new->core.mapped_when_managed'
        as the new setting.  XtSetMappedWhenManaged() sees that the new
        value and the current value in the widget (the 'new' widget) are the
        same, and returns without actually affecting the mapping of the
        widget.

REPEAT-BY:
	Do anything that changes the mapped_when_managed flag.

FIX:
	The Core's set values routine should probably have passed in the
        'old' widget Id, instead of the new.
