VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 4/110

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2

DISPLAY:
	B/W

SYNOPSIS:
	Text widget does not understand all of the events it
	should using the default translation table.

DESCRIPTION:
	The default Text widget translation table does not recognize
	all of the events it should on a Sun4/110.  Namely, shifted
	Meta operations are not processed correctly.  The <Meta>
	is ignored, and the character is just inserted into the text.
	For example, <Meta><Shift><.> should mean <Meta> ">", or
	go to end-of-document.  Instead, ">" is inserted into the text.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run X11 on a Sun4.
	- start xmh, and Compose a new message.  Compose uses a Text
	  widget for editing the new message.
	- enter the key combination that should mean <Meta> ">" using
	  the default translation table.  On a Sun4/110, with a
	  Type 3 keyboard, using the default keymap, this means
	  pressing the Left button, then Shift, then the ". >" button.
	- rather than moving the cursor to the end of the file, a
	  ">" will be inserted at the current cursor position.
	- also, typing Left "[" should move to the previous paragraph.
	  No shift keys are necessary here, but the Text widget
	  still just inserts "[" into the text.  Left "]" works
	  just fine, however.  Left Delete (aka Meta-Delete) also
	  fails to delete the whole previous word.  It is treated
	  like a plain Delete, and deletes only the previous character.
