To: xbugs@athena.mit.edu

### bug number:   355
### area:         Xt
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	Core dump in lib/Xt/Event.c
DESCRIPTION:
	line 546:

	if (widget == NULL) {

	this condition should always return because passing a NULL widget
	to the following conditions causes an error. However if this
	condition doesn't find a spring_loaded widget it continues.

REPEAT-BY:
	Pass events to XtDispatchEvent that are nothing to do with the
	toolkit when you have no spring_loaded widgets (a valid thing
	to do I would contend).
FIX:
	insert `return;' before line 556

I hope this is clear!
