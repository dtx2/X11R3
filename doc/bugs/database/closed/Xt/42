VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
        Adding a global translation to a realized widget destroys the
        widget's translations.

DESCRIPTION:
	As I reported in an earlier bug report, if a new translation is
        added to a realized widget (using XtOverrideTranslation), and the
        action to which the translation is tied has not been previously used
        for that widget, all of the translations for that widget get
        destroyed.

REPEAT-BY:
        Register a global action routine, and set up a translation for a
        realized widget which uses this action.

FIX:
        There were actually several problems in the translation
        manager which contributed to this problem.  They include:

        1) After the first time a widget's translations were bound, the
           proc_table size was never again changed; even if future translations
           referenced different action routines.

        2) After an augment or override request, the translations were not
           really being rebound; this is a result of the table being the
           wrong size and the fact that only NULL table entries are bound,
           and none of the entries had been NULL'ed out.

        3) The old event handler for the widget was not removed.

        4) The new translations were never installed.
