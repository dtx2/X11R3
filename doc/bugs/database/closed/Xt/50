The following is from Marvin Solomon's recent netnews message:

>One final problem is how to make the popup menu go way if the user doesn't
>choose any of its options.  I still haven't got that to work, but I have
>one more trick I might try:  Define a translation for LeaveWindow on the

The MenuPopup() part of his problem is caused by a bug in the routine
XtConvertStringToBoolean() in TMstate.c.  The line:

    *bP = (Boolean) *(int *)toVal.addr;

should read:

    *bP = *(Boolean*)toVal.addr;
