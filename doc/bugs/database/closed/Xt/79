VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Convex

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	Sun CG on Sun 3/50 running Son 4.0

SYNOPSIS:
	 Programs Using the X toolit crash

DESCRIPTION:
	in lib/Xt, in Resources.c, in the routine XRMGetResources, there is a
	call to XrmCompileResourceList, which is executed if the test in the
	previous line succeeds.  The test is whether the value of 
	resources->resource_offset cast from unsigned to an int is greater
	than 0, if it is, XRMGetResources does it's conversion, and sets
	the value in resources->resource_offset to a negative number.  Thus,
	the test fails subsequently.  Unfortunately, when the convex initializes
	the field resources->resource_offset with the location of a routine, 
	that value is sometimes great enough to cast to a negative number,
	and so the resource doesn't compile.  The convex uses a ring protection
	scheme using the three high bits of the address for protection, and system
	stuff sets the bits to low values, user stuff sets bits to high values,
	which may cast to a negative number.
	
	
REPEAT-BY:
	Compile and run the xwidgets test program supplied by the distribution.

FIX:
	A VERY CRUDE HACK! - I set the test to test for
	 if ((resources->resource_offset <= 0xffff0000)
       which is purely emperical, and works for my application.
