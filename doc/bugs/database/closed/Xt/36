### bug number:   893
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	Recently a bug report came across the net, which dealt with the
      use of the MenuPopup action, and how button up events were not
      being passed along the the popped up shell (see bug # Xtk 752).
      No fix was supplied; this report contains the fix.

DESCRIPTION:
      The _XtMenuPopup() procedure uses an internal procedure (in TMstate.c)
      to convert a string to a boolean value; this routine is
      XtConvertStringToBoolean().  This routine in turn makes a call to
      XtConvert(), where the actual conversion takes place.  Upon return
      from XtConvert, XtConvertStringToBoolean() attempts to grab the
      return value out of the 'to' structure.  Unfortunately, it treats
      the pointer in the 'to' structure as a pointer to an integer, instead
      of as a pointer to a boolean.  Thus, on 68000 architectures, this causes
      bogus bytes to be grabbed.

REPEAT-BY:
	 Run the test program supplied with the original bug report

FIX:

*** TMstate.old.c	Fri Aug 19 11:17:27 1988
--- TMstate.c	Fri Aug 19 11:16:28 1988
***************
*** 1341,1347
      XtConvert((Widget) NULL, XtRString, &fromVal, XtRBoolean, &toVal);
      if (toVal.addr == NULL) return FALSE;
  
!     *bP = (Boolean) *(int *)toVal.addr;
  
      return TRUE;
  }

--- 1341,1347 -----
      XtConvert((Widget) NULL, XtRString, &fromVal, XtRBoolean, &toVal);
      if (toVal.addr == NULL) return FALSE;
  
!     *bP = *(Boolean *)toVal.addr;
  
      return TRUE;
  }
