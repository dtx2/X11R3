Subject: Shells without a managed child cannot be realized

(And more generally, ANY widget with a 0 width or height cannot be realized.)

Your program created a top-level application shell with a call to
XtInitialize, and a child with a call to XtCreateWidget.  However, it did not
manage the shell's child, either by a separate call to XtManageChild or by
using XtCreateManagedWidget rather than XtCreateWidget.

This leaves the shell's width and height fields 0.  When the shell's realize
method is called, it calls passes these 0 values onto XCreateWindow.  For some
reason I've never understood the server considers it a bug when you try to
create a window of size 0,0.

So your program is okay now, but the intrinsics really ought to be
fixed--perhaps in several places.  For example, I've seen this 0,0 problem
before, and it STILL took me a while to find it.  A check for 0 width or
height in XtCreateWindow would be far more useful than the cryptic error that
Xlib returns.  And in this specific case, the shell's realize procedure should
probably check to see that its child is managed, which would have been an even
more useful error to you.
