### bug number:   420
### area:         Xt
### severity:     medium
### comments:     workaround: don't reuse these resources
### status:       closed


VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	CoreDestroy() frees up resources owned by the application

DESCRIPTION:
	When a widget is destroyed, the CoreDestroy() routine frees up
        the background pixmap and the border pixmap, if they are defined.
        Unfortunately, these resource were owned by the application; the
        intrinsics had not ever made their own private copy.  The next
        time the application tries to use that pixmap, an X Error occurs.

REPEAT-BY:
	Create a widget and assign a background pixmap.
        Destroy the widget.
        Create a second widget using the same background pixmap.
        An X Error occurs.

FIX:
	Remove the freeing of the border and background pixmaps from
        CoreDestroy().
