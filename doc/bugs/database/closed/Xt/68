Subject: VPaned doesn't handle geometry requests properly

### bug number:   346
### area:         Xt
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160C or 3/75M

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or Sprite (Berkeley experimental)

DISPLAY:
	cg2 or bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	 When VPaned receives a geometry request from a child whose
	 allowResize resource is True, it responds to the requesting
	 widget correctly, but leaves the other panes in the widget
	 unaltered.

DESCRIPTION:
	 When a VPaned widget grants a geometry request to one of its children
	 and its refigureMode is On, it should not just recalculate the new
	 positions for its panes, but actually alter them. At the moment,
	 its data record one set of locations and the windows themselves
	 display another, causing annoyance to the user (i.e. me).

REPEAT-BY:
	Create a VPaned widget with two panes, one of which is allowed to
	resize (I used a Box widget and added a large Command widget to it
	to force it to resize) and make that one resize (either smaller
	or larger -- smaller makes the effect clearer).
