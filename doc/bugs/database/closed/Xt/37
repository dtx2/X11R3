Subject: X Toolkit bug .. in TMstate.c

### bug number:   915
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     
### status:       closed


VERSION:
	X Toolkit X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/75

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5 and SunOS 4.0

SYNOPSIS:
	MenuPopup Action of shell widget in X Toolkit does not set the
	grab correctly. So events do not get propagated to the
	first spring loaded grab on the grab list. Therefore MenuPopdown
	won't work unless the pointer is exclusively in the shell widget
	that was popped up.

DESCRIPTION:
	When the MenuPopup action is used in a translation table it
	does not set the grab to XtGrabExclusive and spring_loaded = TRUE.
	This is due to a bad conversion from a string to boolean.
	This happens in XtConvertStringToBoolean() of Xt/TMstate.c on
	the line ..

	*bP = (Boolean) *(int *)toVal.addr;

	This will work fine on a VAX which is Little Endian but fails
	on a SUN which is a Big Endian machine.

REPEAT-BY:
	Write a program which uses a popup widget and set the translation
	for the popup shell to call MenuPopdown when the button which
	popped it up is released.

FIX:
	change the offending line of XtConvertStringToBoolean() in
	Xt/TMstate.c to

	*bP = *(Boolean *)toVal.addr;

	This gets the byte ordering correct and works on a VAX and a SUN.
