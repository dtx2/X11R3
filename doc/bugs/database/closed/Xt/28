Subject: there's no way to force widget destruction

### bug number:   264
### area:         Xt
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed
### comments:     requires change to XtDispatchEvent, ala XtPurgeWidgets
                  WSL has a compatible mod to XtDispatchEvent that may
                  make XtPurgeWidgets unnecessary.

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160C or 3/75M

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or Sprite (Berkeley experimental)

DISPLAY:
	cg2 or bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	 Because of the postponement of widget destruction until XtNextEvent
	 is called, there's no documented way to force widget destruction,
	 and subsequent state cleanup, without getting another event.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The problem comes using a modified DiskSrc for a Text widget
	 that creates a temporary file. When the widget is destroyed,
	 the temporary file is removed. Unfortunately, the only way to
	 get these callbacks called, officially, is to call XtNextEvent,
	 which will cause the client to wait for another event to
	 arrive. This is especially annoying when one wishes to exit the
	 client, as I do in this case. One then has to type another character
	 in the window for the client to exit.

FIX:
	Provide a "blessed" way to force the destroy list to be processed.
	While this opens the toolkit up to stupid programmers calling this
	function at the wrong time, it is an important function to provide.
