Subject:        XToolKit name resource bug

### bug number:   782
### area:         XT
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	BellTech 386

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNIX System V/386 Release 3.0

DISPLAY:
	EGA

SYNOPSIS:
	 The X Toolkit is not picking up the "name" resource.

DESCRIPTION:
	 You can specify -name and the icon name changes, but putting
	 an entry in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property for name does
	 nothing.

REPEAT-BY:
	1) Run xterm, specifying the name on the command line:
		xterm -name NewName1 &
	   Observe that when this xterm is iconified, "NewName1" appears
	   in the icon.

	2) Make an entry for xterm in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property:
		cat | xrdb -merge
		xterm*name:NewName2
		^D
	   Run xterm without the -name option:
		xterm &
	   Observe that when this xterm is iconified, "NewName2" does not
	   appear in the icon.

FIX:
	?
