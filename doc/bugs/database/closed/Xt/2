VERSION:
	X11 release 1
SYNOPSIS:
	If the font specified in the resource list is not found, a garbage 
	value is given for the pointer, rather than NULL.
DESCRIPTION:
	When a font structure is specified in an XtResource list (such as in
	xload and xclock), but the string given for the font name is illegal
	or the font name is non-existant, the toolkit does not return a NULL
	value for the pointer, but some weird value. This is not in keeping
	with established procedure. A pointer is invalid if NULL, otherwise
	the application assumes the pointer is good if not NULL.
REPEAT-BY:
	Do an 'xset fp wierd'. This will set the font path to 'wierd' and
	the toolkit will not be able to find any fonts. Start an xclock or
	xload without any command line parameters. You should get a message
	to the effect that the font cannot be translated to a font structure.
	The next message will be about a segmentation violation and core dump.
	If the address in the font pointer in the Initialize routine in the
	clock widget is printed, you will notice that the value is not NULL.
FIX:
	<Preferred, but not necessary>
