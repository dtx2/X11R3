### bug number:   449
### area:         Xt
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110C, Sun 3/50, Sun 3/260, Sun/3E (Tried on all)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
    All the command widgets in the program below do not get displayed initially.

DESCRIPTION:
    For some a reason when the program below is run with a least 200 command
widgets they do not get refreshed properly.  Usually the first 150 widgets
get painted and the rest are empty windows.  The command I used to duplicate
the problem is "program 300 =1000x800".

    It would be greatly appreciated if we could get a fix ASAP.  We have
a demo to a potential customer in mid-May :-).

REPEAT-BY:
Heres the program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>
#include <X11/Box.h>
#include <X11/Command.h>

Widget toplevel;
Widget window;

void main(argc, argv)
    unsigned int argc;
    char **argv;
{
    int            i;
    Arg            args[10];
    char name[256];

    toplevel = XtInitialize(NULL, "XBoxes", NULL, 0, &argc, argv);

    window = XtCreateManagedWidget( argv[0], boxWidgetClass, toplevel, NULL, 0);

    for (i = 0; i < atoi(argv[1]); i++) {
	(void) sprintf(name, "Widget #%d", i);

	args[0].name = XtNborderWidth;
	args[0].value = (XtArgVal) (1);
	XtCreateManagedWidget(name, commandWidgetClass, window, args, 1);
    }

    XtRealizeWidget(toplevel);

    XtMainLoop();
}

FIX:
No idea
