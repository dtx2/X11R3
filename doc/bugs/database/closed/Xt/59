Subject: x toolkit documentation deficient

### bug number:   96
### area:         Xt
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	(e.g. Sun 3/280, Microvax II, HP 9000, IBM PC/RT, etc.)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	(e.g. Ultrix 2.0, SunOS 3.4, 4.3bsd, etc.)

DISPLAY:
	(e.g. QVSS, GPX, CG4, HP TOPCAT, etc.)

SYNOPSIS:
	x toolkit documentation is VERY weak.

DESCRIPTION:

	It does not adequately explain how to add additional resources
	nor does it explain how to retrieve those resources via
	command-line options.  My program will normally use a
	particular file in the user's home directory, but I want them
	to be able to specify another file via the command-line option
	"-file".

REPEAT-BY:
	(What you did to get the error; include test program if appropriate)

FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
