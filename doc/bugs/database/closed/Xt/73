I don't like "cursor-flash".  So I recently attempted to configure xmh to
always use a single cursor, regardless of which subwindow it is in.

The simple entry

*Cursor:	left_ptr

doesn't do it.

So I went looking, and discovered two problems:

1.  Scrollbar is full of cursors which have a Class that is a direct
derivative of their name.  So I have to know every stupid cursor that
scrollbar wants to use in order to make things right.  I find the world would
be much simpler if all cursor resources have a class of Cursor.

2.  The "#define" names for the cursors are not the same as the strings they
define.  The #define names are abbreviated versions.  This only leads to more
confusion...the #define names should always be directly derived from the
strings they represent.  No abbreviations, etc.
