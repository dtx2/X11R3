Subject: resources shared through Xrm get doubly-freed

### bug number:   541
### area:         Xt
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160C or 3/75M

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or Sprite (Berkeley experimental)

DISPLAY:
	cg2 or bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	 Because of the resource caching done in the resource manager,
	 there are times when a resource will be freed twice.

DESCRIPTION:
	 As a prime example of this, when a font name is converted to an
	 XFontStruct * by two different widgets, the XFontStruct * is
	 shared between the two widgets, as it should be, but this is not
	 taken into account when the widgets are destroyed. If in my
	 application I open two windows (Text widgets with a modified
	 disk source) and close them individually, the XCloseFont for
	 the second widget fails with a BadFont error. This always happens
	 on the second close no matter how many windows I open.

	 Revision: Turns out it's not the Text widget that's freeing the
	 fonts. but one of my own. NEVERTHELESS, there should be a way to
	 find the number of widgets sharing a given resource and have
	 it freed when everyone is done. Perhaps this is in the
	 soon-to-be-released new Intrinsics spec?

REPEAT-BY:
	see above.

FIX:
	the shared resources need to have some sort of reference count to
	avoid this so a widget can completely clean up its state, otherwise
	this can be a substantial core leak....
