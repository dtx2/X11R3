Subject: Atoms.h bug

### bug number:   751
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     



VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Calcomp

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.2bsd

DISPLAY:
	Calcomp

SYNOPSIS:
	There are two Atoms.h.  One in X11 include area created during
	the install and one in the lib/Xt area which is a link to 
	StringDefs.h.  xterm will not compile using the Atoms.h in the 
	X11 include area, but will with the Atoms.h in the lib/Xt area.

DESCRIPTION:
	Clients such as xterm use Atoms.h from the /usr/include/X11
	area.  This file is created during the install.  In lib/Xt there
	is also an Atoms.h which is a link to StringDefs.h.  xterm will
	compile with the Atoms.h in lib/Xt, but cannot find defines 
	and will not compile with the Atoms.h created in /usr/include/X11.
	Specifically in main.c XtRString is not defined in the Atoms.h in
	the X11 include area.  Why is this file created instead of being a 
	link to StringDefs.h in the X11 include area.  Why is this a link 
	to the StringDefs.h file (why not just use StringDefs.h)?

REPEAT-BY:
	make xterm in clients xterm area.

FIX:
	have clients use StringDefs.h instead of Atoms.h.
