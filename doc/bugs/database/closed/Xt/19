VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/260

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG2

SYNOPSIS:
	bug in toolkit intrinsics does not allow > 819 widgets


DESCRIPTION:
	 In Xtk/Event.c the routine ExpandTable, which expands
	the widget/window hash table does not work properly.
	This causes clients who create more than 800 odd widgets to
	dump core.

	After the fix below is applied, another problem appears:

	Now a single client which creates more than 4000 widgets
	crashes the server.  It is possible to have two clients one
	with 2000 and one with 3000 though.  I can get away with 
	around 1500 widgets for my application so I will leave this
	problem to someone more ambitious.


REPEAT-BY:
	Create many widgets.


FIX:
	new ExpandTable():

---------------------------------------------------------------

static void ExpandTable() 
{
    HashTable   oldTable = table;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int newsize;
 
    i = oldTable->size * 2;   
    newsize = (unsigned) sizeof(HashTableRec)+i*sizeof(HashRec);
    table = (HashTable) XtMalloc(newsize);
    memset((char *) table, 0, newsize);
    table->size = i;
    table->count = oldTable->count;
    for (i = 0; i<oldTable->size; i++) {
        HashPtr hp;
        hp = oldTable->entries[i]; 
        while (hp != NULL) {
            HashPtr temp = hp;
            _XtRegisterWindow(hp->window, hp->widget);
            hp = hp->next;
            XtFree((char *) temp);
        }
    }
    XtFree((char *)oldTable);
}
