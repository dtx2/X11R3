Subject: Bug in Xlib region code

### bug number:   645
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
        X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
        At least RT, Sun and Microvax

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        as appropriate

DISPLAY:
        Does not seem to matter

SYNOPSIS:
         The code in XSetRegion does not properly package up the correct
        set of regions to send to the server.

DESCRIPTION:
         The code in XSetRegion allocates the appropriate set of rectangles
        for the region being used to clip to and then copies the rectangles in
        the region structure but copies them all into the first rectangle.  Thus
        only the last rectangle from the region structure gets sent to the
server
        and a set of garbage rectangles.


REPEAT-BY:
        Running an Andrew application with two overlapping windows.  The first
        overlapping the upper left corner and the second overlapping both thus
        creating an L shapped exposure area with the Andrew application (when
        the second is moved to the bottom).  Now move the second overlapping
        window to the bottom and only the lower part of the Andrew window
redraws.

FIX:
        The code in XSetRegion in lib/X/XRegion.c should be changed to:

XSetRegion( dpy, gc, r )
    Display *dpy;
    GC gc;
    register Region r;
{
    register int i;
    register XRectangle *xr;
    LockDisplay (dpy);
    xr = (XRectangle *)
        _XAllocScratch(dpy, (unsigned long)(r->numRects * sizeof (XRectangle)));
    for (i = 0; i < r->numRects; i++) {
        xr[i].x = r->rects[i].x1;
        xr[i].y = r->rects[i].y1;
        xr[i].width = r->rects[i].x2 - r->rects[i].x1;
        xr[i].height = r->rects[i].y2 - r->rects[i].y1;
      }
    _XSetClipRectangles(dpy, gc, 0, 0, xr, r->numRects, Unsorted);
    UnlockDisplay(dpy);
    SyncHandle();
}
