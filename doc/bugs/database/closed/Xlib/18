VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	QDSS

SYNOPSIS: 
	C-/ doesn't type a C-_

DESCRIPTION:
                    -----
	Typing Ctrl | ? | on the LK201AA keyboard doesn't type a C-_
	            | / |
	            -----
but instead types just a plain slash.  I couldn't figure out how to
rebind this using xmodmap, and I have been told that it isn't
possible.   (This did work under X10 without any rebinding.)

REPEAT-BY:


FIX:
