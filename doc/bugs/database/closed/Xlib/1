Subject: XConnDis.c and constructing the expanded name
Date: Wed, 16 Mar 88 11:03:42 -0800
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@decwrl.dec.com>

### bug number:   132
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     high
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE: VS2000 (actually any)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:  Ultrix 2.2 (actually any)

DISPLAY: QDSS (actually any)

SYNOPSIS:
	The expanded_name return value was an empty string if the
	display_name argument started with a colon.

DESCRIPTION:
	When constructing the expanded name near the end of the procedure
	_XConnectDisplay, the possibility that the first character was NUL
	was overlooked. This happens when the display_name argument is of
	the form ":0", such as is often specified in /etc/ttys.

	Xterm now uses the macro XDisplayString to get the value for the
	environment variable. This is used when the tty is not a slave.

	Also note that the Instanllation Guide and Release Notes has the
	/etc/ttys entry missing the "-display" on the command line.

REPEAT-BY:
	I ran xterm from init with the argument "-display :0" and when
	it got started the DISPLAY environment variable was 0 characters
	long.
