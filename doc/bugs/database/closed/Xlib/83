Hi,

XPolygonRegion works fine when the points I give it define a rectangle
with horizontal/vertical edges, but anything else fails (gives me an
empty region, I think).  I looked at the code and noticed that it
detects rectangles.  So it must be that the non-rectangle branch
doen't work.  I'm very interested in using regions, but if you
wouldn't mind, I'd like to know soon if I shouldn't count on them.
Thanx.
