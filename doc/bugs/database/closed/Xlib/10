VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	amiga 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	amigados V1.3

DISPLAY:
	amiga 640x400 monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	_XReadEvents can block unnecesarrily

DESCRIPTION:
	_XReadEvents first calls _XFlush.
	If _XFlush blocks on call to write it will call _XWaitForWritable.
	This routine reads packets until it can finally write something
	out.  When  _XWaitForWritable finally can write on the socket it
	returns and _XFlush returns to _XReadEvents.  _XReadEvents then
	drops into a loop looking for something to read. If there are
	no more packets to be read it will block waiting for another packet,
	yet _XWaitForWritable may have read them all and already
	Queued them up for processing.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run xcalc and let it start up by itself. Notice it does not complete
	the calculator text on the buttons until the X-cursor enters the
	calculator region when the server sends another event the the calculator
	process.

FIX:
	The fix is to just move the while (dpy->head) to the top of the loop
	instead of the bottom in _XReadEvents.
	The following is a diff file for XlibInt.c
