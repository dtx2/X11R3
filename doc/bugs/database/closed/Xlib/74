Subject: Portability problem in library text routines

### bug number:   929
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

Hello all,
	Here's a little problem I found while porting the library.

VERSION:
        X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
        AT&T 3B2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        System V Release 3.2

DISPLAY:
        EGA

SYNOPSIS:
        Text routines in the library assume that structures (specifically
	xTextElt) aren't padded.

DESCRIPTION:
        The files XPolyTxt.c, XPolyTxt16.c, XText.c, and XText16.c use
	xTextElt (defined in Xproto.h) to introduce a text element on the
	wire.  Because the structure is allocated directly in the outgoing
	buffer, any padding (say N bytes) is mistaken by the server for the
	for the first N characters of the string.

REPEAT-BY:
        Compile the library with a compiler that pads structures to 32 bit
	boundaries.

FIX:
	1. Use a two-element array to introduce text elements.
	2. Allocate an xTextElt outside of the buffer and copy the len and
	   delta fields to the buffer later.
	etc.
