Subject: XWriteBitmapFile calls XDestroyImage too soon
To: xbugs@athena.mit.edu

### bug number:   618
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	XWriteBitmapFile uses image fields after a call to XDestroyImage.
DESCRIPTION:
	When XWriteBitmapFile writes out the width and height of the
	bitmap it uses image->width and image->height. Before this
	XDestroyImage has been called on image which causes (in my case)
	the width field in image to be corrupted.
REPEAT-BY:
	I tried to save an 850x850 bitmap using XWriteBitmapFile, the
	width field written out to the file is garbage.
FIX:
	Either use width and height rather than image->width and image->height
	as the size of the bitmap or destroy the image after the width and
	height have been written out.
