### bug number:   808
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     [done --jim]

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xlib

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:

	Xlib fails test suite for:
	    XStoreBuffer
	    XStoreBytes
	    XSetIconName
	    XGetIconName
	    XStoreName
	    XFetchName
	    XFetchBuffer
	    XFetchBytes


DESCRIPTION:

	These routines all use the XChangeProperty Xlib call with format=8.
	The XChangeProperty code used a Data32 macro for format=8, meaning
	it thought the data was in 32 bits/word unpacked format.  By changing
	XChangeProperty, Xlib passed the above tests.

REPEAT-BY:

	Run test suite for above Xlib calls.

FIX:
