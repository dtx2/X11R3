VERSION:
	X11 release 3 beta

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Mac II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	A/UX 1.0

DISPLAY:
	Mac II monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	The recent patches to the SIZEOF macro don't build correctly.

DESCRIPTION:
	In lib/X/GetPRoot.c, sizeof_xPseudo{Screen,Depth,Visual} are undefined
	because the definitions of those constants in lib/X/PseudoRoot.h are
	has #ifdef MUSTCOPY around the definitions.

	Three files in the extensions/lib directory make calls to the GetReq
	macro defined in Xlibint.h.  GetReq uses the SIZEOF macro, resulting
	in an attempt to find the following sizeof_x??? definitions for the
	indicated files.  None of these definitions exist:

	XFillZoids.c:	sizeof_xPolyFillZoidReq
			sizeof_xSetZoidAlignmentReq
	XPlxVideo.c:	sizeof_xVideoReq
	XTestExt1.c:	sizeof_xTestFakeInputReq
			sizeof_xGetInputReq
			sizeof_xStopInputReq
			sizeof_xResetReq
			sizeof_xQueryInputSizeReq

	In addition, since the sizeof_x constants are now defined for all
	machines, the file server/ddx/macII/macIIKbd.c file didn't compile
	since there were now too many includes for server/ddx/macII/cpp.big
	to handle.  We're considering what to do about this.

REPEAT-BY:
	Install the SIZEOF macro patches, do a "make World" from top level.

FIX:
	Preferred -- add something to the machine-specific imake.include files to
	only use the new SIZEOF patch if it is needed (i.e., the machine's 
	compiler pads structures out to 32-bit boundaries).

	Otherwise:

	Remove #ifdef MUSTCOPY and corresponding #endif at bottom of PseudoRoot.h.

	In extensions/include/zoid.h, add
		#define sizeof_xPolyFillZoidReq 12
		#define sizeof_xSetZoidAlignmentReq 12

	In extensions/include/plxvideo.h, add
		#define sizeof_xVideoReq 12

	In extensions/include/xtestext1.h, add
		#define sizeof_xTestFakeInputReq 72
		#define sizeof_xTestGetInputReq 8
		#define sizeof_xTestStopInputReq 4
		#define sizeof_xTestResetReq 4
		#define sizeof_xTestQueryInputSizeReq 4
