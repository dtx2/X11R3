VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 3

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

WINDOW MANAGER:
	all

AREA:
	Xlib

SYNOPSIS:
	XGetWindowProperty will return a nil pointer on zero length properties.

DESCRIPTION:
	The Xlib manual states that if XGetWindowProperty succeeds that it will
	set the prop_return argument to be a nul-terminated (allocating an
	extra byte, word, or longword for the zero) object containing the
	data.  However, properties that are of zero length fail to have the
	1 object prop_return allocated.

REPEAT BY:
	xfd -tl '' on an r2 uwm; watch your window manager dump core
	attempting to free a null pointer
