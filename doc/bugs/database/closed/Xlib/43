### bug number:   810
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     [done, calls _XRead16Pad -- jim]

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xlib

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:

	Xlib failed test for XChangeProperty

DESCRIPTION:

	Xlib is failing the test for XGetProperty, format=16.  This is
	because the server sent an odd number of properties (3), and the
	_XRead16 code read exactly what it was told to (6 bytes).  This
	left the buffer pointer two bytes in front of the data it wanted
	to read for the next reply, giving d0 01 01 00 01b9.  

REPEAT-BY:

	Run test suite for XChangeProperty, format 16.

FIX:
	Fix to XlibInt.c, routine _XRead16
