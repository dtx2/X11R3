Subject: Xlib bug in XLookupString
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu

### bug number:   610
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	any

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	Apollo

SYNOPSIS:
	XLookupString in Xlib does not properly handle vendor-private keysyms.

DESCRIPTION:
	XLookupString ignores the high-order 2 bytes of the keysym value,
	and assumes they are zero.  If a vendor-private keysym with bit 29
	turned on happens to match a standard keysym in the low 16 bits, it
	will be taken to be that standard keysym.

REPEAT-BY:
	Define some new keysym with bit 29 on, like:

#define apXK_Paste              0x1000FF04

	Get this into the ks_names.h file and rebuild Xlib, and some client
	like xterm.  Now if you bind this to some key and type that key in
	the xterm, you will get control-D!!!

FIX:
	Note this is with respect to the R2 version of XKeyBind.c, i.e. before
	any patches (like patch 20) are applied.

        Is there any symbol defined for the vendor-private bit in a keysym
        value (i.e. 0x10000000)?  I couldn't find one in a cursory inspection.
