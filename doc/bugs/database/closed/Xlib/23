There seems  to be a slight oversight in the Xlib specification of the fields of the
display structure -- there are macros and functions to retrieve nearly all the
interesting parts in it, EXCEPT for the min_keycode and max_keycode. Thus
a programmer wanting to read the keyboard encoding has to go in there and get
these fields out explicitly.  In the manual not in Xlib.h have I seen mention of
macros or functions for accessing these fields.

Am I missing something?
