### bug number:   737

### severity:     low
### comments:     [done -- jim]

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xlib

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	XQuTree fails
DESCRIPTION:
	In reading the XQuTree reply from the input buffer, the code
does not unpack the data or the correct number of bytes of data.

REPEAT-BY:
	Running the Xlib test for XQuTree

FIX:
	Use XRead32 to unpack.  Calculate correct number of bytes to
unpack from input buffer to user.
