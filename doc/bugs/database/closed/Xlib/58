### bug number:   305
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Version 11 Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

AREA:
	Xlib

SYNOPSIS:
	Xlib should provide a non-exiting version of _XDefaultError.

DESCRIPTION:
	Applications frequently want to print out "standard" XErrorEvent
	messages, but might not want to exit.  Instead of requiring people
	to copy the code, there should be a utility routine that prints
	the information.

REPEAT-BY:
	look at the code

FILES:
	lib/X/XlibInt.c

FIX:
	Make _XDefaultError call something like 

		XDefaultErrorMessage (dpy, event, stderr);
