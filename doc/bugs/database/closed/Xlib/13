Subject: bugs in Xlib region code
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 88 20:57:44 -0700
From: hania@decwrl.dec.com

### bug number:   385
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     fairly high
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

XEqualRegion and XEmptyRegion are bogus (I didn't look at the source
for the other region routines).  I believe that XEmptyRegion will
always return FALSE; at least it will return FALSE on a newly created
(and thus empty) region, as well as on regions whose clip box has width
0 and height 0 (although x or y different from 0).

The first line in XEqualRegion:

    if ( r1->size != r2->size ) return( FALSE );

is probably wrong.  I believe that the size field has to do with the
amount of space allocated to hold this region, and not necessarily with
what the region actually contains.  Moreover, it should first check
whether the regions it is given are both empty; as it is now, it has
the same bug as XEmptyRegion in that it will assert that two empty
regions which differ only in their extent fields are unequal.
