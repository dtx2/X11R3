### bug number:   261
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

Why in both the server and Xlib is MAXSOCKS defined to be (NOFILE - 1)?
I can see that in the server you may want to save a file descriptor for
fonts or something, and that mechanism seems to be in place, but in Xlib,
it looks like there's potential for problems.  Suppose that NOFILE is 33.
Then MAXSOCKS in Xlib will be 32, and MSKCNT will be ((MAXSOCKS + 31) / 32),
which is 1 -- not enough bits for 33 file descriptors.  No place in Xlib
is the number of FDs allowed open actually restricted by MAXSOCKS, so would
there be trouble?
