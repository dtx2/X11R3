Subject: Xlib bugs

### bug number:   467
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
     X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
     Xlib 'Xfree' doesn't check for NULL pointer.
DESCRIPTION:
     Xlib 'Xfree' doesn't check for NULL pointer.
REPEAT-BY:
     Do XGetStandardColormap() without defining the property first .
     Execute on an HP machine.
     (many other commands associated with properties are effected
     and, of course, any command that calls Xfree is suspect).
FIX:
     Change Xfree from  
          #defind Xfree(ptr) free((ptr)) 
     to
          #define Xfree(ptr) if((ptr)!=NULL)free((ptr))
