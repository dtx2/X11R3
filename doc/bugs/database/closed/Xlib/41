### bug number:   807
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     done -- jim

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xlib

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	XSetIconSizes fails test suite
	XGetIconSizes fails test suite
DESCRIPTION:

Xlib failed these tests with Operand Range Error during malloc processing.  
The source for XSetIconSizes malloc's memory according to the calculation:
	nbytes = count * SIZEOF(xPropIconSize);
Well, this is one case where SIZEOF is incorrect, because XSetIconSizes
is putting unpacked (64 bit) values into the memory allocated, so
in assigning values in the malloc'ed buffer, it runs off the end of
the buffer.  The next call to malloc fails.  Both tests call XSetIconSizes.


REPEAT-BY:
	Running the Xlib test for XSetIconSizes or XGetIconSizes

FIX:

	Fixed by replacing SIZEOF with sizeof.

< 	unsigned nbytes = count * sizeof(xPropIconSize);

> 	unsigned nbytes = count * SIZEOF(xPropIconSize);
