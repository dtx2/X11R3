### bug number:   738
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     [done -- jim]

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xlib

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	XSendEvent test fails
DESCRIPTION:
	The test failed with a wrong input queue count.  The Event that
was returned by the server was 0x80, but should have been 0x9c, because
0x80 is only a flag that this is in response to an XSendEvent request.
The XSendEvent request was built incorrectly in that the Event it 
wished to pass to the server was in the wrong place, ie. shifted over
by four bytes.  This is because the definition of the XSendEvent request
in Xproto.h contains a member of type xEvent, which is a structure.
The xEvent struct gets word aligned on the Cray compiler.
typedef struct {
    CARD8 reqType;
    BOOL propagate;
    CARD16 length B16;
    Window destination B32;
    CARD32 eventMask B32;
    xEvent event;		/* this gets forced to Cray word boundary */
} xSendEventReq;


REPEAT-BY:
	Running the Xlib test for XSendEvent

FIX:
	I kluged up the following, but don't really like it:
XSendEvent.c:
40,42d39
< #ifdef CRAY
< 	bcopy(&ev, (char *) req + 0x0c, SIZEOF(xEvent));
< #else
44d40
< #endif
