### bug number:   996
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     high
### comments:     this was fixed by patches that were sent out recently

VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    Symmetry S81, Dynix 3.0.12


DISPLAY:
    Sun 3/50, SunOS 3.2, MIT R2 (+ some patches) sample server


WINDOW MANAGER:
    uwm


AREA:
    Xlib


SYNOPSIS:
    I don't think I need to set MUSTCOPY, but PseudoRoot.h has the 'sizeof_'
    stuff protected by it, making GetPRoot.c hard to compile.


DESCRIPTION:
    (Am I missing something???)


REPEAT BY:
    Try to compile GetPRoot.c without setting MUSTCOPY.
