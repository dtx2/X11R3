Subject:        XParseColor return values are documented incorrectly

### bug number:   512
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Bell Technologies 386/AT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3

DISPLAY:
	Video 7 VEGA (IBM EGA clone)

SYNOPSIS:
	XParseColor return values documented incorrectly

DESCRIPTION:
	The documentation for XParseColor states that it returns the
	"exact" colors for later use.  In fact, it only returns the exact
	colors for hexadecimally specified colors.  For colors in the
	rgb database, the *screen* definition is returned.

REPEAT-BY:
	Eyeball the code for XParseColor.

FIX:
	XParseColor.c should be changed to be consistent.  Either the
	"exact" fields in the XLookupColor reply should be used, or the
	hexadecimal code should use a server round trip to resolve the
	hexadecimal color to a "screen" definition (and fix the documentation
	to match).  Since I am not sure which the designers of X intended,
	and the fix is trivial, I have not included a patch.

	(Note:  see previous related bug report on XLookupColor and hexadecimal
	colors).
