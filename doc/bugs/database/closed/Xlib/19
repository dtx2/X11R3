Subject: XTextExtents SEGV on undefined default char

### bug number:   604
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	MicroVax II

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

AREA:
	Xlib

SYNOPSIS:
	

DESCRIPTION:
	Using a font such as times-roman18, with no default char (or
	specifically, a default char of 0 and a lowest char of 32) measuring
	the XTextExtents of a string with undefined chars in it causes a
	reference through uninitialized data. The fix is simple:

FILES:
	lib/X/XTextExt.c

FIX:


diff lib/X/XTextExt.c XTextExt.c.old
148c148
<           for (i=1; i < nchars; i++) {
---
>           for (i=1; i < n; i++) {

nchars is what the user passed in, n is the number of actual glyphs
created. XTextWidth in the same file is correct; I haven't checked
XTextExtents16.
