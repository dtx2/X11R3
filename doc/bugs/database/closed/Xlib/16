Subject: XLookupString maps KEYPAD SPACE to nul

### bug number:   445
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     special case needed for protocol problem

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	All

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	All

DISPLAY:
	All

SYNOPSIS:
	The protocol spec defines KEYPAD SPACE as 0xff80 -- 
	XLookupString return nul for KEYPAD SPACE.

DESCRIPTION:
	In keysymdef.h in the X11R2 distribution, there is a
	definition of XK_KP_Space just under a comment:

/* Keypad Functions, keypad numbers cleverly chosen to map to ascii */

#define XK_KP_Space		0xFF80	/* space */

	But, this maps to ascii nul (0x00) when the mask of 0x7f is
	applied in XLookupString.

REPEAT-BY:
	Well, I haven't seen this because the LK201 keyboard I use
	doesn't have a `space' key on the numeric keypad.

FIX:
	Fix XLookupString to special case this one.
