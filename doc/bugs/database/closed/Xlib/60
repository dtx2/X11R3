Subject: identifier "class" confuses C++

### bug number:   731
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

[ the uses in Xresource.h could be changed to avoid problems, but not
the use in Xutil.h ]

The word "class" is used as a local identifier in the files Xlib.h,
Xresource.h, and Xutil.h.  The AT&T C++ preprocessor appears to treat
the word "class" as a reserved word.  Although not an absolute
requirement, it would be nice if we could include these files in C++
modules.
