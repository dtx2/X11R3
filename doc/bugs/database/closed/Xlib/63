Subject: lib/X/XGetImage.c; Ones() is signed

### bug number:   781
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     



VERSION:
     X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
     Bug in Xlib file XGetImage.c; Ones() doesn't work if mask has high bit set.
DESCRIPTION:
     In the file XGetImage.c the function Ones() returns a neg number 
     if the high bit in the mask is set.
REPEAT-BY:
     Use the mask 0xffffffff.
FIX:
     
     change declaration of y in Ones() to unsigned. i.e.,

     static unsigned int Ones(mask)                /* HACKMEM 169 */
         unsigned long mask;
     {
         register unsigned int y;
     
         y = (mask >> 1) &033333333333;
         y = mask - y - ((y >>1) & 033333333333);
         return ((unsigned int) (((y + (y >> 3)) & 030707070707) % 077));
     }
     
     /* here's a short test */
     main()
     {
       printf("Ones(%x)=%d\n",0xf,Ones(0xf)) ;
       printf("Ones(%x)=%d\n",0xff,Ones(0xff)) ;
       printf("Ones(%x)=%d\n",0xffff,Ones(0xffff)) ;
       printf("Ones(%x)=%d\n",0xefffffff,Ones(0x7fffffff)) ;
       printf("Ones(%x)=%d\n",0xffffffff,Ones(0xffffffff)) ;
     }
