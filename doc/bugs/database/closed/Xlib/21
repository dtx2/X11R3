Most having to do with lint. Some are simply "inconsistencies" rather
than "bugs", but they still cause complaints.

Assume you want to create a pixmap from an image. XCreatePixmap wants
the width and height as unsigneds, the ximage structure has them as ints.

Likewise XPutImage wants width and height as unsigned ints, while the
image structure has them as ints.

SetNormalHints is a void proc but not declared in any .h file.

XSetTransientForHint is a void proc but not declared in any .h file.

XSetClassHint is a void proc but isn't declared in Xlib.h

CopyFromParent is a long unsigned, it is supposed to be compatible with
Visual * (as well as a bunch of other things. This can never be made typesafe...)

The toolkit initialization routines everywhere pass argc around as a
"Cardinal" (unigned int) Xlib's XrmParseCommand (to which this thing is
ultimately passed) wants an int.
