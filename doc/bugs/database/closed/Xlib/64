VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Tektronix 4317 (probably actually any)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UTEK 2.3 (~=4.2bsd kernel + some 4.3 utilities)
	(probably actually any)

DISPLAY:
	Tektronix 4317 (probably actually any)

SYNOPSIS:
	In the toolkit usage of the resource manager, "*" takes 
	priority over "."

DESCRIPTION:
	Area: toolkit, xrm
	Files: probably Xrm.c

	The Xlib spec on the resource manager has a prioritized list of 
	rules for matching resources.  Item 2 in this list says that dot
	takes precedence over "*".  I infer from this that if you load the 
	following resources:

xbiff.Background: green
xbiff*Background: red

you get red when you should have gotten green.  Swapping the entries
demonstrates that it is indeed the "*" that is controlling the result.
However, the problem does not appear with

bitmap*BorderWidth: 5 
bitmap.BorderWidth: 0

This gives a width of 0.  So I infer that the problem is in the
XrmQGetSearchList routine used by the toolkit, not in XrmQGetResource,
used by Xlib.

FIX:
	I ws not able to spot the problem right away in the convoluted
	rm code, but a temporary workaround should be to convert the
	toolkit back to using XrmQGetResource (better slow than wrong).
	The recent bugfix to SearchList allocation in xt/Resources.c 
	does not affect this problem.
