### bug number:   642
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     
### status:       closed
                  I have code to fix the buffer overflow problem.
                  I've sent a message to xlib and intrinsics about the \<NULL>
                  case.
                  ralph, 8/29: fixed (Xrm.c rev 1.14)

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 (unpatched)

SYNOPSIS:
	sloppy code in lib/X/Xrm.c

DESCRIPTION:
	Inspection of the source shows that the static functions
	getstring and PutLineResources will handle bad input
	incorrectly
	
	When getstring is confronted with a string that isn't
	terminated by \n, it will require *two* terminating null
	bytes to recognize the end of the string.  And when a line
	is longer that the size of the buffer, it will forever
	return the same data when called repeatedly.
	
	In PutLineResources, a terminating null byte preceded by a
	backslash will go undetected, so any garbage left in the buffer
	will be appended to the resource.

FIX:
	If the X consortium people really have no time to fix this, I'll
	cook up a fixed version and mail it to you, but I'd rather not
	work on something that has already been fixed.
