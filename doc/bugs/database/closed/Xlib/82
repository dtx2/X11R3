### bug number:   1035
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    all


DISPLAY:
     n.a.


WINDOW MANAGER:
     n.a.


AREA:
     Xlib.h


SYNOPSIS:
     declaration of non-existant routine.


DESCRIPTION:
    XGetIconWindow is declared to be of type window in Xlib.h.  The routine,
however, does not exist, it having been superceded during V11 beta by
newer routines with more general semantics.
	Unfortunately the declaration was not removed when the routine
was deleted from the library.


REPEAT BY:
    inspection


SAMPLE FIX:
    delete the declaration.
