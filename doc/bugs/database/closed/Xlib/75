### severity:     ehhancement
### comments:     rather bogus....




VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/260
	Sun 3/60
	Sun 4/110

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	Connection to X server should have "close on exec" mode
	set.


DESCRIPTION:

	Client A creates a window and maps it.
	Client A forks, creating client B.
	Client B exec's a new application.
	Client B creates a window and maps it.
	Client A exits.

	Problem: Client A's window is still displayed.

	NOTE: These problems were observed from applications
	built using the toolkit. They do not appear to be
	toolkit related.

REPEAT-BY:

	Sequence described above.

FIX:
	Have XOpenDisplay() issue:
		fcntl(dpy->fd, F_SETFD, 1)

	to force the connection to the display to
	be closed on exec.  The solution for process that
	fork but do not exec is less clear. Perhaps XOpenDisplay
	should check to see if a connection has already been
	established, and if so close it.
