### bug number:   274
### area:         xmh
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed
### comments:     very useful idea

I can't figure out how to access the message I am replying to
when replying in xmh. The link named @ dosen't seem to be there,
and even if it were, the text widget is not a friendly place
to have to insert indentation to an entire block of text.

Failing this, could xmh learn to use the (gnu)emacsclient protocol
as an option?
