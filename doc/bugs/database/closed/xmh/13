VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/140 / Sun4

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun 3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	Focus dosen't get inherited by pop-ups.

DESCRIPTION:
	I claim that when the keyboard is focussed to an application,
and that application pops up window to solicit input from the user,
that the focus should travel down into the pop-up. 

You can demonstrate this with the xmh Compose button.
