### bug number:   275
### area:         xmh
### severity:     
### assigned to:  swick
### status:       closed
### comments:     

The "Compose Message" button in the composition frame is deadly.
Once I use it, I cannot get ANY part of xmh to receive any
keyboards input. I have to close the main frame and recreate it.
Forcing the focus with uwm has no effect on the problem.
