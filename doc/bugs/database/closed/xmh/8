VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/140 -- server on Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	3/50 display

SYNOPSIS:
	Create Folder in xmh dumps core. 

DESCRIPTION:
	Click on create folder. A miniscule window will pop up which
appears to solicit a "label" (the name of the folder?). However, no
amount of focussing will get anything to appear in it, and there isn't
enough room for a respectable name, anyway.

If you click the confirmation box, xmh dies with a core dump.

REPEAT-BY:
	As above.
