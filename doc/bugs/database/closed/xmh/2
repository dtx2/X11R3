VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun B/W

SYNOPSIS:
	 xmh puts its window on the screen, but never puts any text in the 
	 panels and does not respond to any input or mouse clicks.

DESCRIPTION:
	 Following is id of our version of the mh package:

version: MH 6.4 #14[UCI] (arthur.cs.purdue.edu) of Fri Apr 10 16:15:26 EST 1987
options: [BSD42] [BSD43] [TTYD] [MHE] [MHRC] [NETWORK] [BIND] [RPATHS]
         [ATZ] [PURDUE_CS] [SBACKUP='"#"'] [SENDMTS] [SMTP]

	 Following is a dbx "where" on a core of the running xmh.  Core was obtained
	 with the "gcore" command:
		Reading symbolic information...
		Read 2240 symbols
		(dbx) select(0x73c7c) at 0x3da34
		_XRead(0x73c7c, 0xeffec84, 0x20) at 0x2f02f
		_XReadEvents(0x73c7c) at 0x2efb7
		XWindowEvent(0x73c7c, 0xd0007c, 0x8000, 0xefff4b8) at 0x2ebf1
		TUScanFileForToc(0x8332c) at 0xb741
		TUEnsureScanIsValidAndOpen(0x8332c) at 0xc515
		TocSetScrn(0x8332c, 0x837fc) at 0x93d9
		InitializeWorld(0x1, 0xefff9d8) at 0x474d
		main(0x1, 0xefff9d8, 0xefff9e0) at 0x49b1
		(dbx) 

	The xmh process just hangs there.  All of the standalone mh commands work
	fine in an xterm window....

	Install was done unchanged from the source code as shipped, with new
	Makefiles.

REPEAT-BY:
	Just run xmh

FIX:
	Dunno.  I'm open to suggestions.
