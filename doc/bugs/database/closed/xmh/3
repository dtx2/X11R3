VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4 and 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	I sent in an xmh bug report last week describing how sometimes
	xmh won't paint text in the boxes on startup.  Here's more info
	on the problem.

DESCRIPTION:
	I've begun to notice a possible pattern on when the problem occurs.
	If I read mail via MH at the Unix shell while I'm not running
	xmh (say during the evening from home), then xmh won't startup
	correctly the next morning.  It displays the above behavior.  I
	have a workaround too!  When I run X.V11R1 xmh, exit, and run
	X.V11R2 xmh, it works.

	Note: this was not a scientific study!  I've tried it a couple
	of times -- it seemed to work.

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
	I don't have a fix, but I hope the above might help in finding
	one.  I might suspect the folder cache data code....?
