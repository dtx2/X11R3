From: Tim Becker <becker@cs.rochester.edu>

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4 (and 3.5)

DISPLAY:
	Monochrome (not hires)

SYNOPSIS:
	Xmh behaves strangely on startup.

DESCRIPTION:
	Sometimes on startup, xmh won't paint text into the boxes.
	Othertimes it does put in the text.  All the time, it paints a long
	rectangular box that is as tall as the screen (ok), but only 2 inches
	wide.  In addition, it doesn't leave any space for the messages
	TOC box.  I could try to send a window dump if that would help - 
	let me know.

	It's reading the default app-defaults file.  So, unlike a posting to
	xpert, that's not my problem.

REPEAT-BY:
	Ran xmh.

FIX:
	None, sorry.
