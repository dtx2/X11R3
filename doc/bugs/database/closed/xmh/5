VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4 and 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	I've sent in a bug report on xmh not painting text in his boxes
	on startup.  I also sent a followup.  Here's another followup with
	more (close to a fix) detail.

DESCRIPTION:
	I finally recompiled xmh with -g and started it up with dbx.  I
	sent myself mail and inc'd it while I wasn't running xmh.  Sure
	enough, when I started up xmh, it wouldn't paint the buttons
	(or any windows for that matter).  I interrupted the
	program and printed a stack trace.  It was stopped in
	XWindowEvent() inside TUScanFileForToc() in tocutil.c

	Looking at the code, if the folder is out of sync with the xmh
	cache file, it wants to re"scan" the folder.  Before it does
	this it tries to put up an alert bux saying "Rescanning %s".
	It hangs trying to do this -- the message never comes up.

	I don't know enough about Xlib/Xtk at this point to suggest a
	good fix (yes, I could come up with a gross hack -)).  What needs
	to happen is the code needs to check if the application is all
	up.  Possibly it could check on whatever it is that is making
	XWindowEvent() hang (some kind of Xlib/Xtk call is needed for
	this function to work - no doubt).  If the application isn't all
	set up, then don't put up the alert box.  (I put #ifdef notdef
	around the offending code in TUScanFileForToc() and it comes
	up.  So I *know* that I found the problem).
	

REPEAT-BY:
	See above.

FIX:
	Not quite.
