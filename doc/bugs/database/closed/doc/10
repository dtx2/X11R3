Subject: Protocol doc missing AllocColorCells Access error return

### bug number:   956
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Doesn't matter

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Doesn't matter

DISPLAY:
	Doesn't matter

SYNOPSIS:
	AllocColorCells needs to specify an error of Access.

DESCRIPTION:
	The protocol specification on page 63 at the top contains documentation
	for AllocColorCells which allocated writable color cells.  It lists the
	errors as Colormap, Value and Alloc.  The error of Access is not
	present.  This error could be generated if a server doesn't support
	writable colormaps and a client attempts this request.
		
REPEAT-BY:
	Doesn't matter

FIX:
	Add the error Access to the list of other errors.
