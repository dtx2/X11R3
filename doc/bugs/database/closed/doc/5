Subject: Xlib documentation for XStoreNamedColor

### bug number:   892
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Doesn't matter

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Doesn't matter

DISPLAY:
	Doesn't matter

SYNOPSIS:
	One sentence of the description for XStoreNamedColor indicates that
	more than one pixel can be modified, while the other sentences indicate
	that only one pixel is being modified.

DESCRIPTION:
	In the textual description for XStoreNamedColor the following sentence
	appears:
		If more than one pixel is in error, which one is reported in
		the error is arbitrary.
	This description of this request reads much like that of XStoreColors,
	which needs the above sentence.  However, since XStoreNamedColor only
	affects one pixel, this sentence does not make sense.
		
REPEAT-BY:
	Not applicable

FIX:
	Remove the indicated sentence from the description of XStoreNamedColor.
