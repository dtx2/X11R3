Subject: X111R2/doc/Protocol/X11.encoding change request

### bug number:   905
### area:         doc
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	The notation used in the Protocol description can be improved.  Two
	problems occur: the use of N to be both the number of bytes and the
	number of options (these are actually separate values), and the use
	of I to be the number of options (I is hard to distinguish from 1 or l).
FIX:
	I suggest the Protocol document be patched with the following:

% diff X11.encoding~ X11.encoding
100c100
< .PN NameN }
---
> .PN NameK }
111c111
< 	valueN NameN
---
> 	valueK NameK
114c114
< Note that the size of N is sometimes larger that than strictly required 
---
> Note that the size of N is sometimes larger than strictly required 
140c140
< .PN AlternativeN
---
> .PN AlternativeK
151c151
< 	valueI	AlternativeI
---
> 	valueK	AlternativeK
189c189
< 	maskI	mask-nameI
---
> 	maskK	mask-nameK
