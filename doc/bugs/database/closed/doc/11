Subject: XDrawRectangle/XFillRectangle "feature"

### bug number:   1045
### area:         doc
### severity:     
### comments:     needs clarification

You replied to my bug report saying the inconsistency in the size of
XDrawRectangle/XFillRectangle was documented in the protocol.  I don't
deal with the protocol, just the library, whose manual pages say:

NAME
     XDrawRectangle, XDrawRectangles - draw rectyangles

[...]
DESCRIPTION
     The XDrawRectangle and XDrawRectangles functions draw the
     outlines of the specified rectangle or rectangles as if a
     five-point PolyLine were specified for each rectangle:

          [x,y,] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height]
          [x,y]

[...]

NAME
     XFillRectangle, XFillRectangles, XFillPolygon, XFillArc,
     XFillArcs - fill rectangles, polygons, or arcs

[...]

DESCRIPTION
     The XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles functions fill the
     specified rectangle or rectangles as if a four-point
     XFillPolygon were specified for each rectangle:

          [x,y] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height]

[...]

The manual says the same thing, right down to the [x,y,] typo.  The
functions do not behave as documented or expected.  Before sending our
product into the real world, I'd like to know which is correct.

Thank you,
