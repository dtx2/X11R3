Subject: X11R2 Documentation Bug

### bug number:   806
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50 (irrelevant)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4 (should be irrelevant)

DISPLAY:
	Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	 Xlib - C library documentation conflicts with reality

DESCRIPTION:

(This is probably a known bug, but I haven't seen it before.)

At the end of Section 8.4.1.2, we read

"For the XButtonPressedEvent and XButtonReleasedEvent structures, this
member is called button.  It represents the pointer buttons that
changed state and can be set to the bitwise inclusive or of one or more
of these button names: Button1, Button2, Button2, Button4, Button5."

In X.h, dated 1.65 87/09/07 14:57:14 toddb, we read
"
/* button names. Used as arguments to GrabButton and as detail in ButtonPress
   and ButtonRelease events.  Not to be confused with button masks above.
   Note that 0 is already defined above as "AnyButton".  */

#define Button1                 1
#define Button2                 2
#define Button3                 3
#define Button4                 4
#define Button5                 5 "

The actual behavior is consistent with X.h; a SINGLE button name is
returned in each XButton*Event, NOT the bitwise or of several button
names.

REPEAT-BY:
	Read the manual, and try to write a routine to find out which
  buttons have gone up or down.

FIX:
	Rewrite the paragraph. :-)
