### bug number:   197

### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	xload bombs if it cannot find its specifed font and default font.
DESCRIPTION:
	'xload' does not check for a null font pointer in its 'Initialize'
	routine. 'xload' simply passes on what it got, which later causes
	an XError to occur. Better to check for a null pointer and if true
	use the server's font (this is what the clock widget does).
REPEAT-BY:
	xset fp wierd
	xload
