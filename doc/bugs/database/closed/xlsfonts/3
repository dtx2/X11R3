Subject: xlsfonts with long font names can crash
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 88 18:23:39 -0700
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@wsl.dec.com>

### bug number:   1036
### area:         xlsfonts
### severity:     high
### comments:     

On a VAX it gets a floating exception. I expect this is because of a divide
by zero for the number of columns. This is happening because of the code at
line ~250

                columns = (79 + 3) / max_width;         /* 79 for dumb terms */

and max_width is > 82. Some of the DECwindows font names are very long.
