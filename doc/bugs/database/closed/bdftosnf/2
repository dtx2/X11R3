VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    Sun 3/50 running SunOS 3.2


DISPLAY:
    Sun monochrome


WINDOW MANAGER:
    n/a


AREA:
    showsnf


SYNOPSIS:
    Man page missing for showsnf


DESCRIPTION:
    Showsnf is a very useful program to use when working with
    X11 .snf fonts.  There is no man page for it in the directory
    $(TOP)/fonts/bdftosnf.  There should be a simple man page
    which discribes the "-v" and "-g" option.  (The "-g" is
    very useful.)


REPEAT BY:
    man showsnf


SAMPLE FIX:
    n/a
