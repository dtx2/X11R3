The 'showsnf' command seemed a bit unpleasant to use in case of
empty '.bdf' font source files. It works fine if the only argument
to the command is an empty file, but if it is preceded by a bonafide
file, the stuff left over in the font structures make it barf and
core dump.

The fix is simple enough: stick in a

	if (!st.st_size) {
		fprintf(stderr, "empty file....
		exit(1);
	}
between the stat() and the read() in showfont().

Which brings me to another problem, that of the exit(). I like to do
a 'showsnf *.snf', and the ruddy thing stops after every error.
Aw, go on - do the next file! I stuck in returns in place of the
exit()s.

Sorry... just sounding off!
