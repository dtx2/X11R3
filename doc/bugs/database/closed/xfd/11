### bug number:   818
### area:         xfd
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	xfd allows a minimum size too small to use.
	allow "-grey" to work same as "-gray".
DESCRIPTION:
	The user can specify a geometry size of 1x1. Not very useful and
	extremely difficult to resize.
	I forget which spelling to use to get gray. Nice to have both.
REPEAT-BY:
	xfd -geometry 1x1
	xfd -grey
SUGGESTED FIX:
