Subject: incorrect no-op in window.c:DrawLogo
Date: Mon, 13 Jun 88 18:55:00 -0700
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@wsl.dec.com>

### bug number:   600
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	N/A

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	N/A

DISPLAY:
	Digital VS100 (or any machine that uses the DrawLogo hack).

SYNOPSIS:
	a slow no-op of painting background to self in DrawLogo.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The 4th FillPolygon call in DrawLogo seems to be left over from
	some previous incarnation. It is the only one without an explanatory
	picture. It is a no-op drawing of the background to itself in a place
	that the logo is not supposed to be touching.

REPEAT-BY:
	N/A

FIX:
	delete the offending code.
