Subject: alloca for local_alloc in the server.

I note that the IBM RT version of the X11 server uses alloca for the
local allocation, while other versions don't.  Is there any reason why
other systems (like the VAX or the Sun) shouldn't also use alloca by
default?  It's possibly a noticeable performance improvement.
