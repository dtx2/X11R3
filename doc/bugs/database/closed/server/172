Subject: memory leak in PassiveClientGone
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu (X bugs)

### bug number:   849
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

Hi,
In X.V11R2 dix/events.c, PassiveClientGone() has a small memory leak.
It should DeleteGrab(grab) rather than xfree(grab). Notice that
DeleteGrab frees grab->modifiersDetail and grab->keyDetail before
freeing grab.
