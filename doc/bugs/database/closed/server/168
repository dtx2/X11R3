Subject: CopyPlane doesn't check for legal bit plane
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu
Message-Id: <19880814153243.9.RWS@KILLINGTON.LCS.MIT.EDU>

### bug number:   868
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	ProcCopyPlane doesn't check for legal bit plane.

DESCRIPTION:
	ProcCopyPlane checks that only one bit is set,
	but doesn't check to make sure the bit is within
	the depth of the source drawable.  Wierd things
	then happen.

REPEAT BY:
	Try using a bitPlane of 0x40 on a depth 1 drawable.

FIX:
