### bug number:   871
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VAXstation 3200

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	Qdss, 4plane, gray

SYNOPSIS:
	 Specifying width=0 in XQueryBestStipple throws the server into an
	 infinite loop.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The documenation never mentions what the 'width' and 'height' arguments
	 to XQueryBestSize() and friends are there for.  One might guess that
	 the intent is to find the smallest good size >= the given dimensions
	 (although that would contradict the "Best" in the names).
	 This seems consistent with experimentation, which shows that that
	 (at least on this server), width_return is simply width, rounded up to the
	 next power of two.  (Height_return seems to be always the same as height).
	 However, if you specify width=0, the server hangs in run state, consuming
	 cpu cycles.

REPEAT-BY:
Run the following program and type "0 0" in response to the prompt.
Make sure you have another terminal or a network connection to the host
so you can kill and restart the server.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
main()
{
	Display *dpy=XOpenDisplay(0);
	int win,wout,hin,hout,stat;

	if (dpy<=0) printf("can't open display");

	printf("w,h:"); fflush(stdout);
	scanf("%d %d",&win,&hin);
	printf("%d %d\n",win,hin);
	wout = hout = -1;
	stat = XQueryBestStipple(dpy,DefaultRootWindow(dpy),win,hin,&wout,&hout);
	printf("stat %d, wout %d, hout %d\n",stat,wout,hout);
}
