Subject: What does backingStoreSupport in the screen data structure mean?
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 88 19:19:16 -0700
From: joel@wsl.dec.com

### bug number:   1068
### area:         server
### severity:     high
### comments:     


It seems to me that a window should never get any more support for backing
store than min(request, screen support).  The window.c code to set backing
store doesn't do this, but always honor's the user's request. This makes it
impossible for me to turn off backing store by declaring NotUseful in the
screen data structure

Further, window.c sets backingStore in the ChangeWindowAttributes call AFTER the
custom (*pScreen->CreateWindow)(pWin) call.  This makes it impossible for me
to turn off backing store by smashing in NotUseful in my screen-specific
CreateWindow routine.

The only place left is window.c.  This seems like a bad place to do it.  Any
suggestions?
