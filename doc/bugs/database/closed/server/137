VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	HP 9000 series 300

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	HP-UX

DISPLAY:
	All displays

SYNOPSIS:
	Wide dashed lines generally dysfunctional

DESCRIPTION:
	When drawn at almost any non-vertical, non-horizontal,
	non-45-degree angle, wide dashed lines are frequently composed
	of extremely crooked dashes.

REPEAT-BY:
	Draw a wide dashed line (OnOffDash or DoubleDash).

FIX:

The following shar script contains differences to server/ddx/mi/midash.c
and server/ddx/mi/miwidedash.c to make wide dashed lines work more or
less properly.

The diff was performed against the R2 code, and includes one unrelated
change (144c145 in miwidedash.c) that comes from fix-trackers.  Line
numbers may differ between our versions and yours.
