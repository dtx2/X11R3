Subject: a bug [in server with Unix domain socket protection]

### bug number:   343
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3BSD

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	Clients cannot open display 'unix:0' because the socket name
	/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 is protected against world write.

DESCRIPTION:
	When creating the unix domain socket /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 the
	server does not set its umask.  Thus, the socket is created
	with the default mode for root, 755.  This mode makes the
	socket unwriteable by clients which are not running as the
	superuser.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run any program (like uwm) as a normal user and specify the
	display as 'unix:0'.

FIX:
	1) chmod 777 /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 (this won't survive server restart)
	or
	2) edit server/os/4.2bsd/connection.c and fix as indicated:
