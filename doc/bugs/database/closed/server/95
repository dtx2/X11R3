Subject: SaveSet handling of window positions

### bug number:   492
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	any

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	any

SYNOPSIS:
	 SaveSet processing is putting window down off by BW of window.

DESCRIPTION:
	The code for dealing with the outer (rather than inner) top
	left corner of the window was fixed in the R2 release for
	the Reparent call. (pWin->clientWinSize.x is now correctly
	set to "x + bw" instead of "x" as in R1. Similarly for y.

	The call made to ReparentWindow in HandleSaveSet was not adjusted
	to this proper semantics.	

REPEAT-BY:
	Kill reparenting window manager and start it up again. All of the
	windows with non-zero borders will crawl down and right.

FIX:
	In window.c:HandleSaveSet, change the call

            ReparentWindow(pWin, pParent, pWin->absCorner.x,
                           pWin->absCorner.y, client);
	to

            ReparentWindow(pWin, pParent, pWin->absCorner.x-pWin->borderWidth,
                           pWin->absCorner.y-pWin->borderWidth, client);
