### bug number:   421
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VaxStation 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	 manupilating the system date can confuse the screen saver

DESCRIPTION:
	 I was playing with an alarm clock today and set the system date
	 back to 1145.  I then set it forward again to 2000.  This
	 triggered the screen saver, which started drawing the X logo at
	 random positions for a while.  After perhaps a minute I
	 regained control.  I could reproduce this a few times, but not
	 with very different times.  After a while it went away: I could
	 no longer reproduce it.  The server had probably been running
	 for many days (it was 13 days since the last reboot and I am
	 running the server from /etc/ttys).  This was on April 26, 1988.

REPEAT-BY:
	No idea if you can repeat this.  I couldn't myself after a few
	times.  But maybe somebody can detect a logic error in the
	screen saver code, so I thought I'd report it anyway.

FIX:
	Golly, I didn't even have a look at the Server sources and you
	expect me to propose a fix?
