### bug number:   714
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     

X Bug Report:

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 -- X server with fixes 1-10

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	BW2

SYNOPSIS:
	When a Hewlett Packard Pushbutton Widget is created/resized such that
	its height is too small for the text it contains, the server crashes.

DESCRIPTION:
	When a pushbutton is created as the child of another widget, if
	XtNheight is too small for the text inside the pushbutton, the following
	happens:

	When the pushbutton is realized, it is only half drawn. A band of the
	screenextending from the pushbutton to the bottom of the screen is 
	cleared. The X server is killed, the keyboard locks up, and the user
	is logged off. It becomes necessary to execute kbd_mode -a to
	re-establish keyboard functionality.


REPEAT-BY:
	The following program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <Xw/Xw.h>
#include <Xw/PButton.h>
#include <Xw/BBoard.h>

main(argc, argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
	static Arg arglist[] = {
		{ XtNheight,	1},
		{ XtNlabel, (XtArgVal)"I Crash the Server"},
	};
	Widget root, bulletin;

	root = XtInitialize(argv[0], "SErverBug", NULL, 0, &argc, argv);
	bulletin = XtCreateManagedWidget(argv[0], XwbulletinWidgetClass, root,
					 NULL, 0);
	(void)XtCreateManagedWidget(argv[0], XwpushButtonWidgetClass, bulletin,
					arglist, XtNumber(arglist));
	XtRealizeWidget(root);
	XtMainLoop();
}
	

FIX:
	N/A

Thanks,
John
