### bug number:   896
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	APA-16

SYNOPSIS:
	apa16SolidFillArea doesn't work for multiple rectangles

DESCRIPTION:
	I picked up this fix from the ITC.  (I think Andy Palay found it.)
	I haven't seen it in bug-trackers yet, so I thought I'd take the
	liberty of sending it in.

	The problem is obvious.  The loop decremented nbox but
	didn't increment pbox.
