### bug number:   1057
### area:         server
### severity:     medium
### comments:

I believe that SYSAUX_LIBRARIES should be loaded when the servers are built.
For some reason (probably a good one) the LDFLAGS are ignored. However, it
would probably be best to be able to configure in DECnet by editing a single
file.
