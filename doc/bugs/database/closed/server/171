### bug number:   881
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     

DISPLAY:
	all

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	cursors are not reference counted in grabs

DESCRIPTION:
	Reference counts are not incremented (or decremented) for
	cursors stored into passive and active grab structures.
	If the client attempts to free such a cursor, your server
	will probably dump core.

	Also, when a passive grab gets "split" in a deletion,
	cursor and confineTo information is not correctly
	copied to the new grab structure.

REPEAT BY:
	Run the AllowEvents test in the test suite on a Sun, and
	have your server dump core.

FIX:
	coming
