VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50, 3/280, etc.

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Standard Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	 Files in server/ddx/sun do not compile because there is no
	 definition of the "errno" variable defined.

DESCRIPTION:
	 SunIO, SunKbd, SunMouse all reference the "errno" variable
	 but nowhere in the code or include files is the declaration
	 for that variable made.  Perhaps a different version of SunOS
	 has the variable defined in /usr/include/errno.h which is
	 included in sun.h, but it isn't in our version!

REPEAT-BY:
	cd to the directory and type "make"

FIX:
	Add the declaration
	extern in errno;
	in the file server/ddx/sun/sun.h
