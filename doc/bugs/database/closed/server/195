VERSION:
	X11 release 2 with fixes 1-216 plus 260 applied

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Tektronix 4316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UTEK 2.3 (== 4.2bsd kernel with some 4.3 utilities)

DISPLAY:
	Tektronix 4316

SYNOPSIS:
	SaveUnders with awm can crash server

DESCRIPTION:
	Area: server
	Files: (full pathname of files)

	Resizing a window with awm when saveUnder has been loaded as a
	resource can cause a server crash.  The problem is that a
	bad area is passed to the device-dependent routine, xxxSaveAreas.
	The runtime stack shows pathway: SlideAndSizeWindow -> DoObscures
	(bitGravity == NorthWestGravity) -> miSaveAreas -> xxxSaveAreas.
	Routine miSaveAreas says it expects certain things of
	backStorage->obscured and backStorage->oldAbsCorner.  Perhaps these
	have not been met.

	For example:
	our ddx level is being asked to copy from a window starting at
	position 756.  The copy height is 353.  Unfortunately, our
	frame buffer is only 1024 high :-).

REPEAT-BY:
    Using the following 'default' file:

    ----------------------------------default-------------------------------
    awm*saveUnder:	on
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1) xrdb -load default
    2) awm &
    3) xterm -geometry =80x60 &
    4) 'reframe' the window to 80x24
    5) 'move' the window
    6) 'reframe' the window to 80x60


    This should cause the server to crash.

    (These numbers may be specific for the font and our frame buffer size.
    The 80X60 window is entirely on-screen.
    You may have to play around some to get this to happen on another machine).

        FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
