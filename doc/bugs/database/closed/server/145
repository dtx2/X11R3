### bug number:   326
### area:         server
### severity:

### comments:     

I am having no luck getting X.V11R2 to come up on a Microvax II with a
4-plane GPX system.  Initially I had a Microvax II with a qvss subsystem
and I succesfully ran X10, X.V11R1 and X.V11R2, the latter two under
Ultrix 2.2.  I then switched the qvss for a 4-plane color qdss, rebuilt
a new kernel with qd0 support and tried bringing up X.V11R2.

When I try and run Xqdss from another terminal I get a core dump on
a call to malloc within Dispatch().  If I try and re-run Xqdss a few
more times, eventually the system locks up and I have to reboot the system.

When I built Xqdss, I edited the file server/ddx/dec/qdss/NPLANESFILE and
replaced the 8 with a 4.  Is this correct?  I also rebuilt the kernel
with DMA_BUFSIZ set to 10 as suggested in the manual page Xqdss.man.
The only thing I haven't tried is getting qd.o from an Ultrix 2.0 system
as suggested by someone in a message on Usenet.

Does X.V11R2 run on a 4-plane QDSS Microvax II?  What does it take
to upgrade a 4-plane system to 8-planes?  I have access to 3 other 4-plane
GPX systems that are currently idle.  If anyone has any hints I would appreciate
a mail message.  I really want to with a GPX board rather than the QVSS.

Thanks
