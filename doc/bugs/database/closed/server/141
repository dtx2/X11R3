VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Apollo - any

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.2bsd

DISPLAY:
	Apollo - any

SYNOPSIS:
	Getimage returning incorrect bits.

DESCRIPTION:
        Incrementing of the place holder pointer in migetplane was
        incorrect.  The place holder was not being incremented at 
        the end of each scanline.  For scanlines longer than the 
        bitmap pad unit, the fractional bits on the end of the line
        would be overwritten with bits for the next line.  For
        scanlines shorter than the bitmap pad unit, the pointer 
        would never be incremented.

REPEAT-BY:
	Any attempt to use XGetImage
