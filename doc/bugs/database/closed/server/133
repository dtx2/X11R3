### bug number:   359
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       closed
### comments:     

Can you guys change either the header comment in milines.c/miMiter OR 
the code so that the claim of using the GC fill polygon routine is true.
Currently the miMiter code DOES NOT use the GC fill polygon routine.  
First, it probably should, 
Second, if it does not use it, the comment probably ought to be changed.
