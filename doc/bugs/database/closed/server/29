Subject: miRectsToRegion dumps core

### bug number:   122
### area:         server
### severity:     high
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/75

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	1152x900 Monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	The X server dumps core during a resize operation.

DESCRIPTION:
	I have a program which creates several levels of subwindows.
	Under the vanilla X11r2 server, when I resize the base window,
	the server dumps core.

REPEAT-BY:
	I don't have a simple test case.

FIX:
	There is a sort routine in the function miRectsToRegion
	(server/ddx/mi/misetclip.c) which was changed in release 2
	from the bubble sort (in release 1) to a selection sort.
	A bug in the code causes a chain of rectangle pointers to be
	corrupted, and when the server tries to read through the
	corrupted pointer, it dumps core.   The fix is as follows:

% diff misetclip.c.old misetclip.c
298,299c298,299
< 		tbox = *pbox;
< 		*pbox = *ebox;
---
> 		tbox = *mbox;
> 		*mbox = *ebox;
319a320
> 	pbFirst = pb;
321c322
< 	Xfree(pb);
---
> 	Xfree(pbFirst);

	I also changed a loop later in the code which frees up the
	list of rectangles.   This loop neglects to free the first
	element in the list, and frees a null pointer at the end of
	the list.   The last two changes in the diff above reflect
	those changes, so they aren't really related to the bug
	report.

Have fun!
