Subject: AddInputDevice bug?

### bug number:   156
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	AddInputDevice does not zero the DeviceIntRec down[] array.
DESCRIPTION:
	AddInputDevice does an xalloc() to create a new DeviceIntRec
	when a new device is added.  One of the fields in the 
	DeviceIntRec struct is an array that indicates which keys
	are currently down.  This array is not cleared by
	AddInputDevice.  Unless the implementation of xalloc always
	clears the acquired area, the initial state of the keyboard
	is unknown, and the DeviceIntRec may indicate that some
	keys are down when they are not.
REPEAT-BY:
	Added a key device, then checked the state of the keyboard.
FIX:
	AddInputDevice (or somebody) should initialize the down[]
	array to 0.
