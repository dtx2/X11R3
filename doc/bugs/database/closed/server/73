SYNOPSIS:
    DIX routines call pScreen->CreatePixmap with the wrong # of parameters.

DESCRIPTION:
    As defined in the 'Porting Layer Definition', pScreen->CreatePixmap 
    expects 5 parameters:
       pScreen,
       width,
       height,
       depth
       format
    All of the MI routines that call CreatePixmap specify the desired format
    for the created pixmap.  In the DIX layer, the routines that call
    CreatePixmap (CreateGC, CreateDefaultStipple, ServerBitsFromGlyph,
    MakeRootTile, and ProcCreatePixmap) never specify the desired format.
    In the case of depth == 1 this doesn't cause a problem (XYBitmap is
    equivalent to ZPixmap) but when depth != 1 things could breakdown.  In
    fact, cfbCreatePixmap accepts the format parameter (but ignores it and
    always returns a ZPixmap), and mfbCreatePixmap doesn't even declare it.

REPEAT-BY:
    Look at the code.

FIX:
    It seems that a field could be added to the ScreenInfo or ScreenRec that
    would indicate the 'natural format' for the screen, then when the DIX
    routines wanted something other than XYBitmap, they would use the 'natural
    format' for the specified screen.
