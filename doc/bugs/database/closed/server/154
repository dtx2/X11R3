### bug number:   559
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


This is a sample server problem only (not protocol).

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	n/a

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	n/a

DISPLAY:
	n/a

SYNOPSIS:
	InitExtensions() in the sample server is in the wrong place.

DESCRIPTION:
	There are some hardware specific extensions in the world, in my case
	Video Extensions.  It makes no sense to build these into servers which
	do not support video.  Yet the call to InitVideoExtension must be placed
	in server/dix/initext.c.

	I believe this is a flaw.  Since many extensions will be hardware
	dependent, the InitExtensions routine, while still called from dix/main,
	needs to be part of ddx for each machine.  This will prevent building,
	for example, Xqdss or Xqvss with Parallax Video extensions, and not
	require me to edit dix before I build each server.  I think everyone
	else will be happier, too. Allow them to build statically determined
	extensions sets into into each of the several servers they build from
	the same source tree.

REPEAT-BY:
	n/a

FIX:
	Require ddx/<server> to supply an InitExtensions routine, just as each
	must supply screen and device initialization routines.
