Subject: X11 R2 bug report: Depth and root of clipmask not being checked

### bug number:   557
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 with fixes 1-17 applied

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Tektronix 4316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UTEK 2.3 (== 4.2bsd kernel with some 4.3 utilities)

DISPLAY:
	Tektronix 4316

SYNOPSIS:
	Depth and root of clipmask not being checked in ChangeGC.

DESCRIPTION:
	Area: Server

	The protocol says that "If a pixmap is specified as the clip-mask,
	it must have depth one and have the same root as the gcontext 
	(else a Match error).  Dix does not currently check for this.

REPEAT-BY:
	Set clipmask in GC using a pixmap whose depth is not 1.
	The sample server will not complain.
FIX:
