Subject: Bug in X.V11 Release 2 server ddx/mi code
Date: Wed, 16 Mar 88 13:53:31 EST
From: vasudev@decvax.dec.com

### bug number:   136
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       closed


VERSION:
	X11 Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Vaxstation 2000/GPX 

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.2

DISPLAY:
	color 

SYNOPSIS:
	Graphics exposure and No Exposure  events requested by clients 
	require the server to send back Major Code (XCopyArea and XCopyPlane 
	only) and Minor Code 0.  The MIT Xqdss (and I suspect all others) 
	servers do not do this currently. Please see Page 76 of the Protocol 
	Document for further details.

REPEAT-BY:
	Having a client select graphics exposures in graphics contexts
	and checking the returned data.

FIX:
        In X.V11R2/core.src/server/ddx/mi/miexpose.c:

	After line 189 insert:
	pe->u.graphicsExposure.majorEvent = 
		   ((xReq *)requestingClient->requestBuffer)->reqType;
	pe->u.graphicsExposure.minorEvent = 0;

	After line 200 insert:
        event.u.noExposure.majorEvent = 
	           ((xReq *)requestingClient->requestBuffer)->reqType;
        event.u.noExposure.minorEvent = 0;
