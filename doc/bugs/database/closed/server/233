VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    Sun 3/280 running SunOS 3.4


DISPLAY:
    HP topcat


WINDOW MANAGER:
    uwm


AREA:
    server


SYNOPSIS:
    HP server dies with fatal error in Xrealloc if you stress save-unders.


DESCRIPTION:
    If you turn save-unders on a window and then move it around for 20 seconds,
    the HP server dumps core claiming problems in Xrealloc.  It isn't running
    out of virtual memory since the core file is only a 1-1.5 megabytes in
    size.  Without save-unders turned on, it works fine.  There is something
    either in the backing-store (not likely since other machines don't have
    the problem) or in the HP ddx that is trashing memory.


REPEAT BY:
    xev -s &
    move the xev around the screen; within 30 seconds the server will crash.
