### bug number:   91
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       




VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	IBM 6155, Megapel, etc.

SYNOPSIS:
	Missing struct defs and constants?

DESCRIPTION:
	Ran into a real problem when compiling rtscreen.c (located in 
	server/ddx/ibm/rt subdirectory). 

	The complier error messages include:

E "rtscreen.c",L146/C22:	bounds:
|	This can be of an incomplete type only if it is "extern" or has an
|	initializer supoplying its size.

E "rtscreen.c",L180/C2:	bounds: Incomplete type:
|	The type 'struct x_screen_size' (at "rtscreen.c",L146/C8) must be
|	completed before it can be used.

E "rtscreen.c",L181/C2:	bounds: Incomplete type:
|	The type 'struct x_screen_size' (at "rtscreen.c",L146/C8) must be
|	completed before it can be used.

E "rtscreen.c",L182/C2:	bounds: Incomplete type:
|	The type 'struct x_screen_size' (at "rtscreen.c",L146/C8) must be
|	completed before it can be used.

E "rtscreen.c",L183/C2:	bounds: Incomplete type:
|	The type 'struct x_screen_size' (at "rtscreen.c",L146/C8) must be
|	completed before it can be used.

E "rtscreen.c",L184/C25:	QIOCSETSIZE: This is undeclared.


	We looked all over for x_screen_size and QIOCSETSIZE without any luck.

	Also, the compliation of the file mpelio.c (located in 
	server/ddx/ibm/mpel) failed beacuse:

E "mpelio.c",L108/C17:	CONS_MPEL: This is undeclared.

	Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing some files?

thanks for any help,

     SYNOPSIS:

You need ACIS 4.3 plus 2-Feb update (IBM part number 5799-WZQ).  The
missing declarations are in new header files on that update.
