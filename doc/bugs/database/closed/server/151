Subject:        mfbValidateGC checks font boundaries incorrectly

### bug number:   510
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Bell Technologies 386/AT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3

DISPLAY:
	Video 7 VEGA (IBM EGA clone)

SYNOPSIS:
	mfbValidateGC checks font boundaries incorrectly

DESCRIPTION:
	mfbValidateGC decides whether to use fast font routines based on
	the width of the font.  Unfortunately, it calculates the width
	incorrectly, so that fonts with a nonzero leftSideBearing may
	be displayed improperly.

REPEAT-BY:
	Use xfd to display a variable-width font with nonzero (and varying)
	leftSideBearings and average width slightly greater than 32.  Note
	that some characters are displayed incorrectly.

FIX:
	Apply the following patch.

	Note:  this patch was actually developed for our ega implementation,
	which is based on the mfb version.  The line numbers will definitely
	be off, and the patch may be different enough that you will have
	to apply it by hand.
