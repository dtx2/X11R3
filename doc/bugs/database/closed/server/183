Date: Fri, 27 May 88 19:04:48 -0700
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@wsl.dec.com>

### bug number:   544
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE: n/a

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM: n/a

DISPLAY: QDSS

SYNOPSIS:
	 Illegal C code in qdpushpxl.c:qdPPPix1chan: null storage definition

DESCRIPTION:
	 The procedure qdPPPix1chan is basically a no-op. (It is surrounded
	by "#ifdef undef" and "#endif"). However the only remaining piece
	of the procedure is an illegal declaration that shouldn't be there
	to begin with.

REPEAT-BY:
	Compile with a non-Ultrix compiler

FIX:
	around line 250, change

old>    int			mask[];
old>
old>#ifdef undef
old>    register int	chmask = 0xff << (ch*8);

to

new>#ifdef undef
new>    int			mask[];
new>
new>    register int	chmask = 0xff << (ch*8);
