### severity:     medium
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	 Sun 2/50 or Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun 2/50 or Sun 3/50 monochrome 

SYNOPSIS:
	 Server drops connection during request with length > MAX_REQUEST_SIZE

DESCRIPTION:
	I was running one of the X Test Consortiums X11 protocol verification
	tests (BadLength3_r). This test sends a request with a value in
	the length field greater than the MAX_REQUEST_SIZE expected by the 
	server. What happens is the test never really sends all that data
	(which may be a bug with the test). However, the server gets stuck
	in a loop saying give me the data, give me the data ...
	until it times out and drops the connection. 

	The protocol spec says that "Requests larger than this (the max
	request size) generate a Length error, and the server will
	read and discard the entire request."  Because of the timeout
	the client never receives the Length error. Perhaps there 
	should be a check for length error before the actual read
	is attempted.

REPEAT-BY:

	running the BadLength3_r X11 protocol verification test. I am
	not allowed to redistribute this test, although, I believe
	there is a copy of the test suite at MIT. See RWS.

FIX:
	check for length error before trying to read data or on timeout
	send the Length error then drop the connection.
