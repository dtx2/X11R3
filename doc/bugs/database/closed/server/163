### bug number:   805
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


In the R2 release

/* $Header: events.c,v 1.143 88/02/25 17:38:25 rws Exp $ */

the procedure FocusInEvents doesn't work if ancestor is NullWindow,
as it is when the focus switches from screen to screen.  In particular,
since doAncestor is false in that case, eventually the child pointer
reaches NullWindow, and the recursion unwinds returning false in every
case.  This bug causes the windows between the root and the child
to not receive FocusIn events, which isn't so hot for window managers
that are trying to highlight the window with input focus.

Here's what you have:

 /*
  * recursive because it is easier
  * no-op if child not descended from ancestor
  */
static Bool
FocusInEvents(ancestor, child, skipChild, mode, detail, doAncestor)
    WindowPtr ancestor, child, skipChild;
    int mode, detail;
    Bool doAncestor;
{
    if (child == NullWindow)
	return FALSE;
    if (ancestor == child)
    {
	if (doAncestor)
	    FocusEvent(FocusIn, mode, detail, child);
	return TRUE;
    }
    if (FocusInEvents(
	ancestor, child->parent, skipChild, mode, detail, doAncestor))
    {
	if (child != skipChild)
	    FocusEvent(FocusIn, mode, detail, child);
	return TRUE;
    }
    return FALSE;
}


I think that changing the first "return FALSE;" to 
"return child == ancestor;" would fix things up (since it doesn't
make sense to have doAncestor true if ancestor is NullWindow).
