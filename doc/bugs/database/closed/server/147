CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	xsetroot -gray 
	seems to screw up suceeding requests	

DESCRIPTION:
	I got the following error message in response to almost anything
	I tried to do after the "xsetroot -gray". I suppose it will happen
	for any attempt to create GCs.

X Protocol error detected by server: parameter not a Pixmap or Window
  Failed request major op code 55 X_CreateGC
  Failed request minor op code 0 (if applicable)
  ResourceID 0x0 in failed request (if applicable)
  Serial number of failed request 1
  Current serial number in output stream 2
  
REPEAT-BY:
	xsetroot -gray
	xsetroot -solid Black

FIX:
	I leave that to you guys.
