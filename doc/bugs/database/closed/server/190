VERSION:
	X11 release 2 with fixes 1-216 applied

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Tektronix 4316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UTEK 2.3 (== 4.2bsd kernel with some 4.3 utilities)

DISPLAY:
	Tektronix 4316

SYNOPSIS:
	ddx "CopyWindow" routine being called for InputOnly windows

DESCRIPTION:
	Area: server
	Files: server/dix/window.c 

	In at least one case, dix is not checking for a window being
	class InputOnly and is incorrectly calling a ddx routine to change
	bits on the screen when there are, of course, no bits.
	Routine dix/window.c/MoveWindow() is calling *pWin->CopyWindow
	without regard to window class.


REPEAT-BY:
	Bug was found by resizing windows in the Andrew environment, but I
	can't tell you the exact steps to take because I don't know how
	to do it.

        FIX:
	I fixed this locally by putting checks for class InputOnly in all
	the ddx routines which modify window bits.  I think the proper
	fix is to put the checks into dix to avoid trying to alter
	non-existent bits of InputOnly windows.
