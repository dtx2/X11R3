### bug number:   37
### area:         
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

Try examining the "unselected" cursor in an xterm running Xsun in color -- the
top right and bottom left corner pixels don't exist. For the "selected"
text cursor, the left edge is missing, if I remember right. Pointed this out
to Sun last May or June, but haven't had time to look myself...

Your message:

I'm using CLX to give this example, so I'm not sure the bug is actually in
the X server, but looking at the CLX code I couldn't see how it could be in
there.

On a monochrome Sun,
Create a window with a white background, and a gcontext with white background
and black foreground.

(xlib:draw-rectangle window gcontext 10 10 100 30 t)

Then

(xlib:draw-rectangle window gcontext 10 10 100 30)


The *non-filled* rectangle is one pixel larger on the right and bottom than
the filled rectangle.

Interestingly this doesn't seem to happen for white on black windows.
