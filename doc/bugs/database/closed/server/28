Subject: format bug in ADMPATH in OsInit()
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu (X bugs)

### bug number:   113
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        4.2bsd

SYNOPSIS:
        The alternate path for error messages, ADMPATH, is formatted wrong.
        This is admittedly very obscure, but I am duty bound to report it.

DESCRIPTION:
        If OSInit ever tries to use the alternate error path, the sprintf
        will try to jam the display string into a %d format:

        [ os/4.2bsd4.2/osinit.c ]

	#ifndef ADMPATH
	#define ADMPATH "/usr/adm/X%dmsgs"
	#endif

	extern char *display;

	OsInit()
	{
	            ...
		    sprintf (fname, ADMPATH, display);
	            ...
	}

FIX:

        Either atoi(display) or change the format to %s
