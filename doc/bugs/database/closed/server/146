### bug number:   367
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	doesn't seem to matter

DISPLAY:
	doesn't seem to matter

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	servers don't respect max-request-length
	connections break with Broken Pipe on large requests

DESCRIPTION:
	Servers aren't checking incoming requests to make sure
	that they are no larger than the max-request-length
	returned in the connection setup info.  The protocol
	doc says the server should generated a Length error if
	this value is exceeded.

	Although servers accept over-large requests, there is
	an apparently magic point, at 131073 bytes (0x20001),
	where connections break with Broken Pipe.  I haven't
	delved to figure out why this is so, except to be
	reasonably certain that it doesn't seem to be
	intentional.

REPEAT-BY:

	Try invoking the following with arg "131048", then "131049".

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xatom.h>

main (argc, argv)
    int argc;
    char **argv;
{
    Display *d;

    d = XOpenDisplay(0);
    XChangeProperty(d,XDefaultRootWindow(d), XA_STRING, XA_STRING, 8,
		     PropModeReplace, malloc(atoi(argv[1])), atoi(argv[1]));
    XSync(d, 0);
    XDeleteProperty(d,XDefaultRootWindow(d), XA_STRING);
    XSync(d, 0);
    XCloseDisplay(d);
}
