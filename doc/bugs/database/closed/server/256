### bug number:   1075
### area:         server
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

In procedure ChangeWindowAttributes , under case CWColormap , the field
XE.u.colormap.colormap is not being set, which results in clients
receiving bogus values in ColormapNotify events.  The line that's
missing (from the obvious place) is

	xE.u.colormap.colormap = cmap;

   Hania and Mark
