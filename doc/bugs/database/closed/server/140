### bug number:   788
### area:         server
### severity:     very hign
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2

DISPLAY:
	Jupiter Systems' Sun Satellite

SYNOPSIS:
	 Server crashes becuaes a very large value is placed in a colormap's
	 clientPixelsBlue[client] array.

DESCRIPTION:
	 Function FindColor(), as distributed, has a serious bug. The value
	 it places in the array indicated by pmap->clientPixelsBlue[client]
	 is the pixel value SHIFTED LEFT by visual's offsetBlue. The value
	 that should be placed in the array is the unshifted value of the pixel.

REPEAT-BY:
	In testing a RGB24 Direct version of our server, I encountered
	this problem. The problem came up when I was tearing down the
	resources associated with an xterm window (i.e. when xterm
	was exiting). The problem reared its head
	in FreeClientPixels(). That's where the very large value bit us.
