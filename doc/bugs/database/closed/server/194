Subject: server bug in mi

### bug number:   931
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
     X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
     miss typing causes problems for 32 bit pixels
DESCRIPTION:
     There are idioms used in the server which don't work for
     32 bit pixel displays.  e.g., in miPutImage(), the line

         for (i = 1 << (depth-1); i > 0; i >>= 1)

     in the XYPixmap case doesn't work since i is declared 
     int rather than unsigned int.  Another case I logged earlier
     was in the function Ones() (in Xlib).
REPEAT-BY:
     You need a 32 bit display.  Try XPutImage().
FIX:
     Check and change all such type declarations.
