Subject:  miarc.c -- Convex passed for non-convex polygons
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu

### bug number:   621
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	mi

DISPLAY:
	mi

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	miPolyFillArc passes Convex for non-convex polygons

DESCRIPTION:

	There is a slight problem with miPolyFillArc: if the arc is not a
	full circle, you are passing Convex to FillPolygon. This is fine if
	it is a half circle or less, but not so fine if more than 180
	degrees. Do you agree? Nobody has noticed a problem, I'll bet,
	because mi does not pay attention to the Convex/NonConvex hint. Diff
	follows:

REPEAT-BY:
	stare at code

FILES:
	server/ddx/mi/miarc.c
