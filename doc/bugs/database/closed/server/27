Subject: ReparentWindow sets clientWinSize wrong
To: xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu (X bugs)

### bug number:   87
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  bob
### status:       

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:

ReparentWindow ignores the borderwidth when it reparents a window at (x,y)

DESCRIPTION:

The actual placement of the window is OK, but clientWinSize, the record of
where the window is placed, is wrong. It should include the borderwidth,
but it doesn't.

REPEAT-BY:

XReparentWindow( dpy, w, p, x1, y1 );
XGetGeometry( dpy, w, ... x2, y2 ... );

If w has borderwidth != 0, then x2 == x1 - borderwidth and  y2 == y1 - borderwidth.

FIX:

Change the assignments in [dix/window.c] ReparentWindow to:

    pWin->clientWinSize.x = x + bw;
    pWin->clientWinSize.y = y + bw;
