### bug number:   700
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2

DISPLAY:
	Jupiter's Sun Satellite

SYNOPSIS:
	 Memory leak in cfb code.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The private portion of a GC (pGC->devPriv) validated in the
	 cfb code contains a pCompositeClip field whose origin is marked in
	 freeCompClip. freeCompClip is initialized incorrectly in cfbCreateGC().
	 The area which pCompositeClip points to is ultimately Xalloc()d
	 by miCreateRegion (me thinks). Anyway, freeCompClip is marked
	 incorrectly by cfbCreateGC() -- it's marked to not be Xfree'd by
	 cfbDestroyGC(). Thus, clip regions attached to temporary GCs
	 are a memory leak.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run a bunch of stuff for a long time on any color Sun server and
	don't be surprised when it runs out of memory.
