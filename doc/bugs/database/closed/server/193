	X BUG REPORT
	xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 (with FIXES 1-33 applied)

CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4 

SYNOPSIS: 
	XGetKeyboardMapping does not appear to return consistent
	results. In particular, the returned KeySyms per KeyCode value
	seems to be wrong or the keysym data is wrong.

DESCRIPTION:
	The following program just prints the results of
	XGetKeyboardMapping. The first argument is the first keycode,
	and the second is the keycode count. I get the following
	results:

	arguments: 84 5
first keycode is 84, count is 5
2 Keysyms per Keycode
keycode 84, keysyms: 48 41
keycode 85, keysyms: 45 95
keycode 86, keysyms: 61 43
keycode 87, keysyms: 96 126
keycode 88, keysyms: 65288 0

	arguments: 85 5
first keycode is 85, count is 5
2 Keysyms per Keycode
keycode 85, keysyms: 41 45
keycode 86, keysyms: 95 61
keycode 87, keysyms: 43 96
keycode 88, keysyms: 126 65288
keycode 89, keysyms: 0 0

	Note that I don't get the same results for the same keycodes.
	Instead, everything seems to be offset by one.

REPEAT-BY:
	try this program:

	********
/*
 * arg 1 = first keycode
 * arg 2 = number of keycodes
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>

main(argc, argv)
     int argc;
     char *argv[];
{
  Display *display;
  int default_screen;
  KeySym *ks;
  int count, spc, i, j;
  KeyCode first;

  if (argc < 3)
    exit(-1);
  
  first = atoi(argv[1]);
  count = atoi(argv[2]);
  display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
  printf("first keycode is %d, count is %d\n", first, count);
  ks = XGetKeyboardMapping(display, first, count, &spc);
  printf("%d Keysyms per Keycode\n", spc);

  for (i = 0; i < count; i ++) {
    printf("keycode %d, keysyms:", first + i);
    for (j = 0; j < spc; j ++) 
      printf(" %d", *ks++);
    printf("\n");
  }
}
	********

FIX:
	don't know
