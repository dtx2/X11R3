VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Prime EXL

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	System 5 Release 3

DISPLAY:
	PC Xsight

SYNOPSIS:
	You cannot destroy retained resources (server/dix/dispatch.c)

DESCRIPTION:
	If a client sets close down mode to RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary
	then goes away, I think you are supposed to be able to get rid of
	his resources with XKillClient.  When the client initially went
	through CloseDownClient, the clientGone flag got set so that the next
	trip through CloseDownClient would really release his resources.
	ProcKillClient, unfortunately, checks the clientGone flag and does not
	call CloseDownClient if it is set.

	It is possible that we have introduced this bug in our server, but
	you should check it out.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run xsetroot a few times and notice that client IDs never get
	re-used.

FIX:
	Remove check of clientGone flag in ProcKillClient.
