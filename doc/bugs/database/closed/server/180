VERSION:
	X11 release 2 with fixes 1-216  plus 260 applied

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Tektronix 4316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UTEK 2.3 (== 4.2bsd kernel with some 4.3 utilities)

DISPLAY:
	Tektronix 4316

SYNOPSIS:
	subwindows under awm not getting backgrounds repainted when resizing

DESCRIPTION:
	Area: server
	Files: server/dix/window.c

	When resizing windows under awm, backgrounds of subwindows are not
	all getting repainted by the server.  You will see the root tile
	show through when resizing the window larger and you will see gadgets
	disappear (gadget pictures are just window tiles).

	I beleive this is the same problem mentioned on the xpert mailing
	list by:
> From: Rakesh Patel <aramis.rutgers.edu!athos.rutgers.edu!rapatel@rutgers.edu>
> Subject: backingstore and screen updates.

	You don't need to be using any windows which request backing store
	to get this to happen.  You do have to be using some version of
	the public domain backing store code in your server.

REPEAT-BY:
	Resize windows under awm

        FIX:
	I do not claim this is the proper fix.  It fixed our problem here
	but may certainly have broken something I don't know about and is
	probably an incomplete fix.  Adam
	deBoor removed the call to TraverseTree in the "ForgetGravity"
	section of SlideAndSizeWindow, replacing it with a RegionCopy of
	pWin->clipList to pWin->exposed.  This removal was carried forward
	into the MIT revision of his code.  Without this line, however, awm
	subwindows will not get properly exposed.

	I just turned around the sense of the ifdef to roll back to the
	old code.
