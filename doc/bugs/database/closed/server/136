Subject: Background-colored part of double dashes drawn with wrong coordinates.

### bug number:   583
### area:         server
### severity:     low

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	HP9000 series 300

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	HP-UX

DISPLAY:
	HP Catseye and others

SYNOPSIS:
	Background-colored part of double dashes drawn with wrong coordinates.

DESCRIPTION:
	This problem showed up after installing a fix-trackers fix in
	the miwidedash.c module.  The fix, to avoid division by zero,
	was to change the ISZERO test to !ISZERO.  The fix-trackers
	corrected code is:

		if(fXmajor)
                    m = !ISZERO(dx) ? (dy/dx) : EPSILON;
                else
                    m = !ISZERO(dy) ? (dx/dy) : EPSILON;

	Since the fix was introduced, the background-colored portion
	of double-dashed lines draws with drastically wrong coordinates.
	
REPEAT-BY:
	Draw wide double-dashed lines.  Use foreground and background
	pixels in the GC different from the window background to see
	the problem clearly.

FIX:
	This kluge appears to make the double-dashed lines work, although
	the reason is not understood.  Replace the four lines above
	(their second occurrence in the source file -- in the code
	drawing the background-colored dashes) with:

		m=EPSILON;

	This kluge should not be mistaken for a real fix.
