If you look in the sun server code (server/ddx/sun/sunCG4C.c or the like)
for the <foo>SaveScreen routine, you will see that the code implements an
ioctl() that turns off the video regardless of what the user specifies as
preferences.  This code could probably be modified to check the global dix
variable "ScreenSaverBlanking" to determine the preference, bypass the ioctl()
and set the return code as appropriate (see the SaveScreens() caller routine
in server/dix/window.c).
