### bug number:   475
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     bug caused by Athena not running standard IBM kernel

imagine being in a workstation cluster full of RTs, with a user at
each keyboard.  imagine all those keyclicks.  billions and billions of
keyclicks.  i only have to listen to one other person's keyclicks
daily, and it's driving me insane.

PLease fix ... before a large part of campus loses their collective
mind.

'xset c' does not seem to work on either a 5.5T or 6.0A RT workstations. I
find the RT keyclick quite loud and would like to be able to turn it down.  
Is there a way to get this fixed before 6.0 gets to the field? a number of 
users have been complaining about this.
