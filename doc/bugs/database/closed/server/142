Robert,

   I'm attempting to get the sample server to work for 4 bit pixels, and 
am running into some problems.  We've cleaned up the cfb code and
this code seems to work reasonable well.  Rather, the problems seem to be 
emanating from the mi and mfb code.  In particular, things like
painting pixels to window backgrounds work, but creating the root
tile does not.  There seems to be problems in dealing with XYBitmap
and XYPixmap images.  An example of one such bug is the routine
miGetImage in 'miBitBlt.c'(version R2).  For the XYPixmap case, the smallest
pixel that will work is 8 bits because of the way the bits are shifted
off the end of the word.  There is another bug in the same code which
occurs if the pixmap width is less than the BITMAP_SCANLIBE_UNIT.  Note that
this is a problem even with 8 bit pixels.  The patch for these two problems is
included in the end of this message.  I would appreciate confirmation of
the problems and my fixes as, although I've tried to fix these in a 
general way, the problem space is so large that I never feel that
confident about a solution.

   Is the mi and mfb code intended to support 4 bit pixels?  Do you
know of other instances where the sample server is being used with
4 bit pixels (without major changes)?  I'm trying to schedule this
project so would appreciate any information you could offer me on this.


Thanks,
