Subject: clip mask problems

### bug number:   1021
### area:         server
### severity:     medium
### comments:     may have already been fixed....

I am using x11 r2 on a sun.  When I try to call XFillRectangle with a clip 
mask that is clear ( all bits set to 0 ) the entire rectangle is drawn 
rather than none of it.  Is there a fix for this or a way to tell if the 
clip mask is clear.  I would appreciate an answer as soon as possible, 
but I understand if you a busy with x11 r3.

Thank you for your time.
