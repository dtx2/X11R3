VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	9733-10

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SINIX V5.2B

DISPLAY:
	don't care.

SYNOPSIS:
	SetPointerMapping

DESCRIPTION:

	SetPointerMapping doesnt return MappingBusy

REPEAT-BY:
	Try to change PointerMapping while a button which
	should be changed is still pressed.

FIX:
	In /server/dix/events.c proc ProcessMouseEvents
	some code of the sort: BYTE *kptr;int bit;
		kptr = &mouse->down[0];
		bit = 1 << (key );
		case PRess:
			*kptr |= bit;
		case Release:
			*kptr &= ~bit;
	should be included.
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
