Subject: line width 1 equived rectangle troubles in MFB

### bug number:   686
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     



VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	VS2000 running BSD 4.3

DISPLAY:
	I haven't the least idea.  It's a normal Athena machine.

AREA:
	Xlib

SYNOPSIS:
	Sometimes, drawing an equived rectangle with line width 1 causes
	a 32 bit wide filled equived rectangle to be displayed directly
 	to its right.

DESCRIPTION:
	That's about it.  The line width must be 1.  I'm not sure if the
	function must be equiv, but clear doesn't do it.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run the following program (link with -lX11).

FILES:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>

#define Black BlackPixel(dpy,scr)
#define White WhitePixel(dpy,scr)
#define NULL 0

Display *dpy;
Window   win;
int      scr;
GC       gc;
XEvent   event;
  
main()
{
  dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
  scr = DefaultScreen(dpy);

  win = XCreateSimpleWindow(dpy,RootWindow(dpy,scr),0,0,100,100,1,Black,White);
  XSelectInput(dpy,win,ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask);
  XMapWindow(dpy,win);

  gc = XCreateGC(dpy,win,0,(XGCValues *)NULL);
  XSetFunction(dpy,gc,GXequiv);
  XSetLineAttributes(dpy,gc,1,LineSolid,CapButt,JoinMiter);

  XWindowEvent(dpy,win,ExposureMask,&event);
  XDrawRectangle(dpy,win,gc,5,5,30,80);
  XWindowEvent(dpy,win,ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask,&event);
}

FIX:
	Sorry.
