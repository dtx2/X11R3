### bug number:   387
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     xmag works fine from SunOS 3.4 to other types of displays




VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	 Sun 3/360

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	 SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	 CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	 running xmag results in a black window, even though the area
	selected with the cross-hair cursor has green and red circles in it.

DESCRIPTION:
	 I can't tell by looking if xmag has an error (grabbed the source
	directly off the net and it compiled fine) or if the server is broken.

REPEAT-BY:
	run xmag with NO flags (it defaults) and choose an interesting area
	of the display by pressing a mouse button. A black window comes up.

FIX:
	?
