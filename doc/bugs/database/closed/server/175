### bug number:   793
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	MicroVAX II/GPX running 4.3BSD Unix

DISPLAY:
	Digital QDSS

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	The server does not correctly draw the white logo when it
	screen saves.

DESCRIPTION:

	When the server is in 'logo' mode, and it displays the X in
	white, there are little 'turds' left where the erasing of the
	extra space does not completely cover the extra space.

	a diagram:

                                 + this line is the extra stuff
                                 v
                  xxxx           x   xx
                   xxxx         x   xx
                    xxxx       x   xx
                     xxxx     x   xx
                      xxxx   x   xx
                       xxxx     xx
                        xxxx   xx
                         xx   xx
                        xx   xxxx
                       xx     xxxx
                      xx   x   xxxx
                     xx   x     xxxx
                    xx   x       xxxx
                   xx   x         xxxx
                  xx   x           xxxx
                       ^
                       + this line is also extra 

REPEAT-BY:
	patch the server so the probabilities of black and white logos
are reversed.  Set the background to mostly black. Set the screensaver
to save, not to blank. Activate the screensaver.  Observe the lossage.

FILES:
	Not sure.

FIX:
	Not sure.
