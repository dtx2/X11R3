Has anyone noticed a problem with mizerline.c

If dy is greater than dx the first scan line is not stored in pspans, and 
if therefore not draw.

This is probably a bug that has already been corrected but I guess we missed
the correction. Where should this be posted?

I have X11R2, the same code existed in X11R1.

I added to my server the line:
	*pspan = pt1; 
immediately after the line:
	/* Y_AXIS */
I also changed the lines (about 12 lines down) from:
	y += signdy;
	pspan->x = x;
	pspan++->y = y;
	*pwidth++ = 1;
to:
	y += signdy;
	pspan++;
	pspan->x = x;
	pspan->y = y;
	*pwidth++ = 1;
