Subject: lowering font filename case

### bug number:   613
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	no matter

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	SUN

SYNOPSIS:
	when the font name is converted to lower case, all of it is

DESCRIPTION:
	in server/os/4.2bsd/filenames.c, the routine that converts the
	font filename to lower case doesn't consider the full path
	case of a font name, and blindly converts the entire thing,
	therefore converting path components as well as the actual
	font name.  Example, the font /usr/dana/X11/TMP/myfont.snf
	would be converted to /usr/dana/x11/tmp/myfont.snf, and would
	not be found.

REPEAT-BY:
