Subject: RT server colormap initialization

### bug number:   185
### area:         server
### severity:

### comments:     

This is a bug in rtCreateColorMapMono (ddx/ibm/rt/rtcolor.c).
The colormap gets set up wrong, so that black is pixel 1
and white is pixel 0.  One symptom of this is that xload & xclock
put up blank white windows.
