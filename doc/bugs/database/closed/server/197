### bug number:   619
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun 3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	xmodmap fails to enable the Alternate key as an additional
	modifier.  Additionally, the Alternate key is mis-KeySym'ed -- it is
	labeled BREAK instead of RIGHT_ALT

DESCRIPTION:

	According to the Sun doc and experiments in raw input mode,
	the key marked Alternate on the sun3 keyboard generates 0x13 in the
	same sense that Left generates 7f.
	
	Thus, I tried feeding xmodmap the following:
	
	keycode 0x13 = Control_R
	add Control = Control_R
	
	this has no discernable result.

REPEAT-BY:
	see above.

FIX:
	the X driver for the sun keyboard adds 7 to each keycode (for all keycodes
	must lie in the range [8..255]) -- try

	xmodmap
	keycode 0x1a = Control_R
	add Control = Control_R

	For the second part, in server/ddx/sun/sunKeyMap.c:

old ****
new ----
****
< XK_Break,	NoSymbol,		/* 0x13 */
-----
> XK_Alt_R,	NoSymbol,		/* 0x13 */
