VERSION:
	X11 release 2 though patch 11.

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II 8 plane qdss

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	8 plane qdss

SYNOPSIS:
XPutImage displays scrambled images from time to time.

DESCRIPTION:
The display should describe it better when you run the porgrams.

REPEAT-BY:
Run the programs which follow IN SEPARATE MESSAGES.

I will send two programs (three files) and two data files (one works with
both, the other is scrambled using XPutImage).

1. view_bitmap: Run using 'view_bitmap <bitmap-file>'
	Compile: cc -o view_bitmap view_bitmap.c -lX11

2. view_image: Run using 'view_image <bitmap-file>'
	Compile: cc -c XCrImageFBF.c
	This file contains the routine XCreateImageFromBitmapFile. It is a
	modification of XReadBitmapFile, with help from
	XCreatePixmapfromBitmapData.
	Compile: cc -o view_image view_image.c XCrImageFBF.o -lX11

3. Data files:
	X.xbm -- The X logo (white X on black background)
	49ers.xbm -- Breaks XPutImage. Run it with view_bitmap first.

This will be followed by 5 messages, each one containing one of the above
files.
