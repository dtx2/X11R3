Subject: Colormaps and root window

### bug number:   505
### area:         server
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

If a client creates a colormap and calls XSetWindowColormap to set the
root window's colormap to the new colormap, then, the client goes away
or otherwises causes the new colormap to cease to exist, the root window
ends up with a colormap of "None". 

About 1/3 of the way through CreateWindow (dix/window.c) is a test that
includes "pParent->colormap == None".  The success of this test results
in BadMatch errors for a large percentage of window creations.  I'm not
sure what may be an appropriate fix, if any, for this problem.

1.  Disallow XSetWindowColormap for root windows.

2.  If a root window's colormap goes away, reset it to the appropriate
    default colormap.

3.  Modify the test in CreateWindow.

4.  Put it in a tuxedo and call it a feature.
