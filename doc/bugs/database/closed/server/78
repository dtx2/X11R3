CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:

SYNOPSIS:
	mfbgetsp.c, cfbgetsp.c - shouldn't they increment pwidth when they
		do ppt++ in getbits/putbits loop 

DESCRIPTION:
	 look at the code, ppt++ is done, but *pwidth is used without
		ever being incremented. ouch?

REPEAT-BY:
	ditto above.

FIX:
 	pwidth++ right after ppt++ ?
