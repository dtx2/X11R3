VERSION:
        X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
        Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        Ultrix 2.0
        
DISPLAY:
        QVSS
        
SYNOPSIS:
	wrong arg to sprintf when completing log-file
	name, leading to bogus file-names
	
DESCRIPTION:
	The ADMPATH macros contains the pathname of the
	log-file for the server. The number of the display
	is put in the file-name,  using a sprintf in the
	routine 'OsInit' in ./server/os/4.2bsd/osinit.c
	The display is passed as a char pointer, while
	the format (ADMPATH) expects an integer.
	This format occurs in the Makefile and in the
	file osinit.c

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
        transform the 'sprintf' call into something
        like:
        	sprintf(fname, ADMPATH, atoi(display));
        Some more checking on the validity of the
        name might be usefull
