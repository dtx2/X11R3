Subject: sample server bug: ListFonts returns too many names
Date: Wed, 18 May 88 08:55:57 EDT
From: Ralph R. Swick <swick@athena.mit.edu>

### bug number:   514
### area:         server
### severity:     
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any.

DISPLAY:
	any.

AREA:
	server/os

SYNOPSIS:
	ListFonts returns names that OpenFont is unwilling to recognize.
	Man page is not helpful.

DESCRIPTION:
	In order to conform to the protocol requirement of case insensitivity
	of fontnames, the sample server insists that all font filenames be
	in lowercase.  However, ListFonts does not exclude invalid filenames
	from the list returned to the client.

	In addition, the sample server man page should list the requirement
	that user-supplied fonts be stored in individual files whose names
	are all lower case.

REPEAT-BY:
	man Xserver
	cp fixed.snf InvalidFixed.snf
	xlsfonts '*xed'
	xfd InvalidFixed

FILES:
	server/os/4.2bsd/filenames.c
