Subject: R3 server bug - nClients decremented too many times.

### bug number:   1043
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     QDSS has similar troubles.


System:	  Sun 4/260, SunOS4.0, Color display, X.V11R3b.  Could not duplicate
	this on a Sun3, or Sun4 w/monochrome, but I didn't try very hard.

Problem:  nClients will sometimes get decremented twice when a single client
	exits.  Eventually, nClients goes to 0 and the server resets itself even
	though there are still clients running.  After this, either the clients
	will die with a protocol error because their window no longer exist,
	or the server will crash with a segmentation violation.

Duplicate by:  Start a single client (I used xinit to spawn an xterm,
	or a test program that created a single window and wrote a string
	to it every 10 seconds). Run 'xsetroot -solid blue' (or any other color)
	2 or 3 times.  The other clients window will be destroyed.  With the
	test program, the client would exit with a protocol error after the
	window was destroyed.

Fix: The server will run if CloseDownClient is changed back to the R2 code by
	deleting line #3210 of dix/dispatch.c.  This looks like a fix for the
	infamous 'growing server' bug, but I don't think it is the right fix.
