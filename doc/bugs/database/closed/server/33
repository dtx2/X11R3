### bug number:   227
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Version 11 Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

AREA:
	server (or possibly Xlib)

SYNOPSIS:
	Growing the keyboard map with XChangeKeyboardMapping messes up 
	keyboard map.

DESCRIPTION:
	Increasing the size of the keyboard map by calling
	XChangeKeyboardMapping with a longer entry still doesn't work.  It 
	ends up adding duplicate entries in strange places, resulting in
	random keys that can't be shifted or unshifted.

REPEAT-BY:
	This was found while looking into have an underscore keysym generated
	for CONTROL-? (on keyboards with ? and / on the same key):

		xmodmap -e "keysym slash = slash question underscore"

FILES:
	server/dix/
	lib/X/XSetPntMap.c [maybe]

FIX:
	not available yet
