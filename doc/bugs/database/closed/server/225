Subject: Xqvss bug under Ultrix 2.2

### bug number:   1019
### area:         server
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VS2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.2

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	 cursor always appears as a solid white rectangle

DESCRIPTION:
	neither clients nor window managers could change cursor
appearance.  It's really hard to see a solid white cursor on a white
xterm background!

REPEAT-BY:
	run Xqvss!  The server was built from the sources on expo with
all of the updates applied using "patch".  I haven't tried compiling
this server under Ultrix 2.0, but I had previously obtained an Ultrix
2.0 binary of a Xqvss server that ran fine under 2.0 but exhibited the
cursor problem under 2.2.

FIX:
This fix was implemented based on a suggestion from Alan Mimms
(alan@apple.com).  It works under Ultrix 2.2, but I don't know if it
breaks things under other systems.
