### bug number:   48
### area:         
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       

Truly?  I might point out that since the if statement will always return true
the else code at the end of the function will never get executed.  If this
isn't a bug it surely is bad programming style.

ps: When I get the core dump adb tells me I was inside MapWindow.

Your message:

       SYNOPSIS:
    	 Look at line 2437 of window.c (in MapWindow)

       DESCRIPTION:
    	 You don't *really* want a single = sign, do you?  :-)

    Yep, we sure do.  The cause of your core dumps must be elsewhere.
    We have had no other uwm bug reports relating specifically to menus
    dumping core.
