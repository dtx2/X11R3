Subject: apa16PolyText8 returns wrong x
Cc: ibmuupa!erik.UUCP@harvard.harvard.edu

### bug number:   1015
### area:         server
### severity:     high
### comments:     ibm ddx-specific

VERSION:

    R3beta

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:

    RT APC running ACIS 4.3

DISPLAY:

    IBM apa16

WINDOW MANAGER:

    uwm (any)

AREA:

    apa16 ddx

SYNOPSIS:

    The value of x returned by apa16PolyText8 should be in the
    window's coordinate system, not the screen's.

DESCRIPTION:

    Justified text becomes a horrible mess unless the window's
    left edge is at the left edge of the screen

REPEAT BY:

    Use an application that performs justification by repeated calls
    to PolyText8, such as Andrew Toolkit applications.
