Resent-Comments: doesn't hang forever, just takes a long time and gets the wrong answer

### bug number:   673
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

Should 'xwd -xy' work on color Suns running X11? If I try
xwd -xy on any of our color Suns (3/110C, 3/60C, 3/260CXP),
it hangs forever. This seems to happen in the XGetImage call.
There's a comment in xwd about version 7 not supporting color,
but I can't find any commented-out code, and I'm not sure
that the -xy option should be affected anyway. Has anyone gotten
this to work?
