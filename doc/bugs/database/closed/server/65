Subject: bug in Sun server b/w colormap initialization

This is a bug in sunBW2CreateColorMap (ddx/sun/sunBW2.c).  I don't
think it manifests itself now.  (At least it doesn't on our Suns.)
You may want to check the analogous functions for other displays.
It looks like they were all copied from one source, and then the
qvss got fixed and the others didn't.
