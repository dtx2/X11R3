### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


In procedure cfbUnnaturalTileFS, there has been a transition to non-rotated
pixmaps.  I don't think that everything has quite made it into a consistent
state.

The if statement at line 370 tests to see if everything fits within one word.
But the ``maskbits'' call just below doesn't use an x offset by rem.  Thus,
this case can make a call to maskbits in which x+w <= 4, and if w is 1 or 2
nlMiddle can end up -1.

I changed the while loop on nlMiddle, this doesn't fix the problem.  It keeps
the thing from going wild, but leaves little turds.

Maybe the call to maskbits should be maskbits(x+(rem&PIM), ...) ?  I don't
really know, this code is confusing to me.
