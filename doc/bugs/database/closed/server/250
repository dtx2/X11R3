	X BUG REPORT
	xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 (with FIXES 1-33 applied)

CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4 

SYNOPSIS:
	The cursor can escape the "confine window" in a pointer grab
	by "flipping" the CG4 screen.

DESCRIPTION:
	In particular, if your confine window is placed close enough
	to the edge of the screen, you can get the screen to switch,
	by moving the cursor to the screen edge. Once the cursor moves
	to the other screen, it is not confined in anyway. Even if the
	cursor returns to the original screen, it is not confined.

REPEAT-BY:
	1. create a window close to the left or right screen edge on a CG4
	2. do an XGrabPointer confining the pointer to the window you
	   created
	3. move the pointer towards the left/right edge of the CG4,
	   causing a screen switch
	4. the pointer should now be free of any confined behavior

FIX:
	?
