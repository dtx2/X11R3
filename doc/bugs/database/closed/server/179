Subject: TraverseTree(ExposeAll) in window.c not according to spec

### bug number:   216
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160C or 3/75M

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2 or Sprite (Berkeley experimental)

DISPLAY:
	cg2 or bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	 When ForgetGravity is in effect in SlideAndSizeWindow, ExposeAll is
	 called for an entire tree, even though the bitGravity of the parent
	 isn't supposed to affect inferiors.

DESCRIPTION:
	 I may be interpreting this incorrectly, but it seems the most
	 reasonable interpretation of the spec. Correct me if I'm wrong.
	 If I'm not, however, the exposure of the entire tree in
	 SlideAndSizeWindow is wrong, though necessary (if you take it
	 out, as I did in the backing-store script I posted, things get
	 rather confused with windows not being exposed correctly and pieces
	 of the parent being copied over the inferiors and the inferiors thus
	 being incorrect.

REPEAT-BY:
	Eyeball the code

FIX:
	???
