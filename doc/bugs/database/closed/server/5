    Truly?  I might point out that since the if statement will always return true
    the else code at the end of the function will never get executed.

It *won't* always return true.  It will return false for root windows.  The
else code will get executed when initially mapping the root windows.

									If this
    isn't a bug it surely is bad programming style.

Using assignments in expressions is arguably bad style, but this isn't a bug.

    ps: When I get the core dump adb tells me I was inside MapWindow.

Fine.  Something else must be wrong.  Perhaps memory is getting trashed.
At any rate, without a stack backtrace and related information, or else
a deterministic way to cause the problem, there isn't much we can do.
