	X BUG REPORT
	 xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu

VERSION:
	X11 release 2 (with FIXES 1-11 applied)

CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4 

SYNOPSIS:
	Once in a while (so far twice in three weeks) I have gotten the 
	error message: "WaitForSomething(): select: errno=22" repeated
	many times in a row.

DESCRIPTION:
	After that no input seems to be read, and I must kill the server.
	
	Both times I was clicking the mouse.
	For SUN OS, errno 22 is "EINVAL" or "invalid argument".

REPEAT-BY:
	I am afraid there is not much else to go on.
	It is pretty rare and I don't know how it get it to happen at will.
	
FIX:
	Don't know.
