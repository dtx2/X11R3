### bug number:   558
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	AllocCP does not allow allocation of all color planes.
DESCRIPTION:
	If AllocCP is called with its argument 'nplanes' equal to
	the number of device planes, it decides that the allocation
	is in error.  This means that the current implementation will
	only allow an AllocColorCells request with a 'planes' value
	that is less than the number of planes in the device.
	So what if I want to allocate all the planes on a newly
	created colormap?
REPEAT-BY:
	running an X10 application through a version of the
	protocol converter you don't have.
FIX:

        (count << planes) > Free)

  	return (FALSE);
