### bug number:   924
### area:         server
### severity:     low

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	QDSS

SYNOPSIS:
	X server does not make sure that unix domain sockets still exist.

DESCRIPTION:
	4.3bsd comes with a script which gets run daily which has a
"find /tmp -atime +3 -exec rm -f {} \;" in it which blows away the
unix domain sockets made by a server after three days.  So, the unix
domain socket goes away, but the login xterm already has the socket
open, so it continues to work.  The naive user comes along, logs in
and then finds that X clients don't work. (The user's DISPLAY
environment variable is set to "unix:0".)  So the user tries logging
out, intending to log in again.  When the user logs out, the xterm
exits closing the last connection to the X server.  The X server
resets, and then comes up again, and /etc/init tries to start a new
xterm as a login process.  The new xterm now repeatedly fails (because
it cannot open the unix domain socket) as /etc/init keeps trying to
start a new one.

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:

(Suggestion) I think the X server should do something to make sure
that the unix domain socket hasn't been unlinked when it resets all of
its state.  This way, at least a user could get back to a completely
winning state by just logging out and letting the server "reset".

(Of course, I can also fix the stupid script, but I'm not convinced
that something else won't blow things away out of /tmp someday.)
