### bug number:   1002
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     the manditory patch sent out last week fixed this problem



This is a very high priority bug....


VERSION:
    R3beta

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    doesn't matter

DISPLAY:
    Digital QDSS

WINDOW MANAGER:
    uwm

AREA:
    server/ddx/dec/qdss

SYNOPSIS:
    Xqdss will sometimes wedge when doing CopyArea from a pixmap to a 
    window that is smaller than the pixmap.

DESCRIPTION:
    The qdss routine for doing CopyArea from a pixmap to a window will
    frequently hang or crash the server (and sometimes the machine).  This
    happens under both Ultrix and 4.3bsd.  The Mailbox widget in xbiff
    seems to tickle the problem when the window is smaller than the
    pixmap from widget the flag image is being copied:

	    /* center pixmap in window */
	    x = (w->core.width - PictureWidth) / 2;
	    y = (w->core.height - PictureHeight) / 2;

	    XSetWindowBackground (dpy, window, background);
	    XClearWindow (dpy, window);
	    XCopyArea (dpy, picturePixmap, window, gc, 0, 0, 
	    	       PictureWidth, PictureHeight, x, y);

    When the window is smaller than the pixmap, x and y will be negative
    and the CopyArea will be clipped by the window boundary.


REPEAT BY:
    put up an xbiff; resize it smaller than 48x48; keep trying small sizes
    until your server wedges
