Subject: xman causes X server core dump when creating directory screen of man3

### bug number:   114
### area:         server
### severity:     fairly high
### assigned to:  rws
### status:       closed


VERSION:
	X11 release 2
 
CLIENT MACHINE:
	microVAX 3500 GPX
 
CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix V2.0 and V2.2
 
DISPLAY:
	qdss (color) the server is Xqdss
 
SYNOPSIS:
	The X server core dumps when a directory screen of section
	3 of the online man pages is requested.
 
DESCRIPTION:
	xman starts up showing a directory screen of section 1 of
	the man pages.  If change directory and section 3 are
	choosen nothing happens for many seconds (15 or so) and then the X
	server crashes.  init restarts the server but all active windows
	are lost.  There are 477 files in /usr/man/man3.

	Although xman is contributed software I beleive that it shouldn't
	be able to cause the server to dump core.

	REPEAT-BY:
		See above

Note:   I am using the Xqdss server from the X.V11R2 distribution with the
following updated module.  I received the patch for this module from rws.
