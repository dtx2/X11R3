Subject: xhost/DECnet problem

### bug number:   842
### area:         xhost
### severity:     low
### comments:     

 
 
VERSION:
	X11 release 2
 
CLIENT MACHINE:
	VAXstation 2000
 
CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.2
 
DISPLAY:
	QVSS
 
SYNOPSIS:
	xhost does not allow hostnames of the form "fubar::" even if
	-DDNETCONN is specified in imake.includes/Vax.macros
 
DESCRIPTION:
	The Imakefile for xhost does not include the ConnectionFlags
	definition, so xhost is not compiled for DECnet, even if everything
	else is.
 
REPEAT-BY:
	% xhost fubar::
	xhost: bad host fubar::
 
FIX:
 
Add DEFINES= ConnectionFlags to the Imakefile.  Context diff follows.
