Subject: x10tox11

### bug number:   127
### area:         x10tox11
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

I sent in a previous bug report this morning which this should
superceed.

If I am running x10tox11 from the console xterm on a sun, and I exit
that xterm, and X shuts down, the x10tox11 hangs around.

If I then start another one when restarting X on my machine, that
latter one hangs for a few minujtes and then aborts with a failure
to bind a TCS socket.

If I try to kill the first one, my machine hangs hard, and must  
be rebooted!
