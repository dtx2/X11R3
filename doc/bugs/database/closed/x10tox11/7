Subject: x10tox11 problems

### bug number:   130
### area:         x10tox11
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

Running X11R2, on a sun3/140, under Sunos3.5. 

I can start up a gnu emacs version 18.49, compiled for X, with no trouble.
Then, I try a c-O (open a blank line). The emacs hangs.

Turning on tracing in the x10tox11 shows lots of activity.
