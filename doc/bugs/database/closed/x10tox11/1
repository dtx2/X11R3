Subject: x10tox11 improperly displays cursors on a vax

### bug number:   115
### area:         x10tox11
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed



VERSION:
	X11 release 2
 
CLIENT MACHINE:
	microVAX 3500 GPX
 
CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix V2.0 and V2.2
 
DISPLAY:
	qdss (color) the server is Xqdss
 
SYNOPSIS:
	A cursor which is on oval on X10 displays as a backwards 'c'
	followed by a forwards 'c'.  I.E., The right half of the oval is
	displayed on the left and the left half is displayed on the right.
 
DESCRIPTION:
	I have an X10 application (xpost) which opens a window and posts a
	message in that window.  The window remains on the screen until it
	receives a mouse event.  When the cursor enters the window I display
	a cursor which is meant to represent an eye (an oval, basically).
	However	when run via the x10tox11 protocol converter the right and
	left halves of the oval are swapped.  Sort of like a byte ordering
	problem.

	x10tox11 is compiled for UNIXCONN and TCPCONN but not DUALTCP.  The
	window is created on the unix:0 display by xpost.

	REPEAT-BY:
		The definition for the cursor is:

	static short cursor[] = {
   		0x0140, 0x0550, 0x15d4, 0x1634,
   		0x59cd, 0x33e6, 0x6633, 0x46b1,
   		0x6633, 0x33e6, 0x59cd, 0x1634,
   		0x15d4, 0x0550, 0x0140};
 
If you require additional information or would like to see the source for
xpost, please let me know.  It is 225 lines of c code.

Subject: My bug report of yesterday concerning x10tox11


The problem I reported yesterday in my message with the subject line 

	x10tox11 improperly displays cursors on a vax

was caused by the routine "ClientByteOrder" in file

	clients/x10tox11/X11/subr.c

The original routine was returning the value MSBFirst regardless of the
actual machine it was running on.  The diff output below shows the
original distributed version and the corrected version of the file.

----

 diff subr.c.dist subr.c
725c725
<       return(MSBFirst);
---
>       return(Bigendian ? MSBFirst : LSBFirst);
