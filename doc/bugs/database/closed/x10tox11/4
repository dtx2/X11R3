VERSION:
	X Version 11 Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

AREA:
	x10tox11

SYNOPSIS:
	x10tox11 X10ProcPixmapBitsPut sets image.depth to 1 and doesn't
	set image.bits_per_pixel.

DESCRIPTION:
	The x10tox11 routine X10ProcPixmapBitsPut sets the depth of the
	XImage that it passes to XPutImage to be 1.  This is incorrect
	for any display that has more than one plane.


REPEAT-BY:
	Run an X10 program that does PixmapBitsPut, such as pikapix.

FILES:
	clients/x10tox11/X11/proto4.c

FIX:
	set image.depth and image.bits_per_pixel to the right values
