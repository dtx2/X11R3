### bug number:   575
### area:         x10tox11
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	IBM APA-16

SYNOPSIS:
	x10tox11 and fancy window managers don't mix

DESCRIPTION:
	x10tox11 sets override_redirect to True on all of its clients' windows.
	this means fancy window managers (ie, anything but uwm) will ignore
	the windows created by x10tox11, generally making them useless.

	The only problem with setting override_redirect to False is that
	double-prompting for the window's position (by the X10 code in the
	client and by the X11 wm) might happen.

	I have found x10tox11 to be much more useful with override_redirect
	set to False.  I think there should at least be a command-line option
	to control this.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run x10tox11, wm, and any X10 program.
