### bug number:   576
### area:         x10tox11
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	IBM APA-16

SYNOPSIS:
	sometimes x10tox11 clients have garbage characters after their name

DESCRIPTION:
	x10tox11 doesn't correctly set the XA_WM_NAME and XA_WM_COMMAND window
	properties.  sometimes it puts a couple garbage characters after the
	name.  it also precedes the client's chosen name with "(X10) ", which
	I don't particularly like.

REPEAT-BY:
	Run an X10 program (whose name's length isn't a multiple of 4) through
	x10tox11.  iconify the window and look at the name uwm uses.
	unless you are lucky, there will be a funny character or two
	at the end of the name.
