VERSION:
	X Version 11 Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

SYNOPSIS:
	x10tox11 doesn't exit when server goes away.

DESCRIPTION:
	The X11IOErrorHandler in x10tox11 (X11/sequence.c) doesn't cause the
	program to exit.  While this might be useful when x10tox11 is run as
	a daemon, it can cause problems if started by the user.  If the server
	goes away, x10tox11 will hang around, possibly holding the port open
	if several X10 clients had been running at the same time (since it
	could possibly miss shutting a connection down if several connections
	die at once).

REPEAT-BY:
	Start up x10tox11 by hand and blow away the server (or the network
	connection to the server).  Notice that x10tox11 is still there.

FIX:
	Have the X11IOErrorHandler in X11/sequence.c cause the program to exit
	if it isn't being run in "daemon" mode (for which a new command line
	option should be added).

	In general, if the server goes away, x10tox11 should make sure that it
	closes all of its connections so that the server can be restarted.
