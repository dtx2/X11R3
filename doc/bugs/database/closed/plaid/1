### bug number:   340
### area:         plaid
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

I don't know if this bug was entered or what the status is of this bug.
Since I did not see it in any of the patches, and I did not get any mail
back, (like I did on another bug) I'm assuming it was never entered.


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	amiga 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	amigados

DISPLAY:
	amiga

SYNOPSIS:
	uninitialized variable being used "char * display"

DESCRIPTION:
	If you do not give any parameters when starting up plaid
	it passes variable "display" to XOpenDis without initializing
	it's contents. (The variable was on the stack.) This causes
	plaid to giveup instead of use the "DISPLAY".

REPEAT-BY:
	plaid

FIX:
79c79
<     char *display = 0;		/* correct code */
---
>     char *display;
