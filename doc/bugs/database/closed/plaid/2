VERSION:

	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	plaid sometimes gives "unknown event type: 19" message

DESCRIPTION:
	typing CTRL/C a couple times to the plaid demo
	will eventually give you the "unknown event type: 19" message

	it does not seem to do any harm, but I think the demo
	should not complain about such common behavior

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
	I leave it to you guys
