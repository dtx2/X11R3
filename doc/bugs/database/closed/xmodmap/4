### bug number:   990
### area:         xmodmap
### severity:     low
### comments:     it might be nice if it were to query the keyboard and somehow
###               let you know which key(s) was(were) pressed

i am able to duplicate this under X11R2 on the VAX 4.3BSD and RT/PC
(AOS 4.3) platforms.

Subject: unhelpful error message 

On a 6.0c RT...

I tried to run 
xmodmap -l Caps_Lock +c Caps_Lock

while caps lock was on, and it failed.  While this is reasonable
behavior I got the following messages from xmodmap...

xmodmap:  You have 2 seconds to lift your hands
xmodmap:  You have 4 seconds to lift your hands
xmodmap:  You have 8 seconds to lift your hands
xmodmap:  You have 16 seconds to lift your hands
xmodmap:  You have 32 seconds to lift your hands
xmodmap:  unable to set modifier mapping, keyboard problem

	While it is nice that it gives you a chance to change what is
wrong, but as I wasn't depressing any keys I couldn't figure out what
was wrong... If xmodmap is capable of detecting which key is
"depressed," it would be nice if the error message changed when the
offending key was a lock key, such as caps lock, num lock and such...
