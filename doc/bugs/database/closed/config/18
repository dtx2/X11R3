### bug number:   606
### area:         config
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Ridge 32-C

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	ROS (= SysV with BSD extensions)

DISPLAY:
	none.

SYNOPSIS:
	Installation problems occur for client-only installations.

DESCRIPTION:
	When installing the X11 distribution with no servers defined,
	the top-level "make World" executes "make depend" in the ./server
	directory.  However, the make variable $(ALL) in ./server/Makefile
	is empty, and this causes a shell syntax error in the loops
	"for i in $(ALL); ...".

FIX:
	I simply commented out the "$(SERVERSRC)" entry in the definition
	of DIRSTOMAKE in the top-level Imakefile.
	There must be a cleaner way to accomplish this...
