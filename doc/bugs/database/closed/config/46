Subject: inconsistent use of SYS_LIBRARIES and SYSAUX_LIBRARIES
Date: Wed, 05 Oct 88 18:36:27 -0700
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@wsl.dec.com>

### bug number:   1055
### area:         config
### severity:     medium
### comments:     xeyes has been fixed; the various macros will be documented

In an attempt to build the Beta R3 version with DECnet turned on, I put
"SYSAUX_LIBRARIES = -ldnet" into Vax.macros and changed the ConnectionFlags
to include DNETCONN. Most things built fine except that

	contrib/xfig/Imakefile
	demos/xeyes/Imakefile

both redefine SYSAUX_LIBRARIES. Xfig is not built by the default "make World"
so that is probably not much of an issue. (Note however that it also redefines
SYS_LIBRARIES, so fixing it may be trickier.)

I think the fix for demos/xeyes/Imakefile is to have it define SYS_LIBRARIES
to be -lm and not SYSAUX_LIBRARIES.
