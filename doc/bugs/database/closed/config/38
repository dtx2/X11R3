Subject: Make install should remove X11/<foo.h> before installing new one

### bug number:   108
### area:         config
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3, but applies to all.

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.2, but applies to all.

DISPLAY:
	BW2, but applies to all.

SYNOPSIS:
	Running make install multiple times can fail to install
	files that were originally installed readonly.

DESCRIPTION:
	 When make install is run, it installs header files, etc.
	 into their respective directories mode 444.  If you change
	 a header file and rebuild the world, then run make install
	 again, the new header will NOT be installed, because install
	 is unable to overwrite the old one.  (At least, this is the
	 case if you do your installs as a non-root uid.)

REPEAT-BY:
	Try doing make install twice.

FIX:
	Change the install rules to remove the old file, if present,
	before trying to install the new one.
