### bug number:   1038
### area:         config
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	???


DISPLAY:
	???


WINDOW MANAGER:
	n.a.


AREA:
	lib/Xt/Makefile


SYNOPSIS:
	something strange


DESCRIPTION:
	If you look at the generated Makefile, you find several instances
of CDEBUGFLAGS, etc.
	I don't understand why the Imakefile has the defines in them,
since it gets put in automatically.
