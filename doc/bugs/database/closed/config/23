Hi -- here's some hints from my experience bringing up X.V11R2.  This was done
on a network of Sun-3's (mostly).  Disk space in '/usr' was very limited, so
all the distribution and 'make'ing was done on another disk '/lang/'.

Where whole directories were shadowed symbolic links were created from
directories on /usr to /lang, for example /usr/bin/X11 --> /lang/usr/bin/X11.
For files (say, in /usr/lib/lint) symbolic links were created for all files.

Changes made to bring system up:
[1] In /lang/X.V11R2/fonts the makefile was changed to add '-p4' as an option
in the Makefile that was made into the snf directory

[2] util/imake.includes/Imake.tmpl:  MANDIR and ADMDIR changed to point
to symbolic links (/usr/man/mann and /usr/adm/X) into /lang

[3] util/imake.includes/sun.macros: DESTDIR=/lang
(that change was fine, but:)
	#define MakeContributed YES
was a complete mistake.  The contrib dirs (particullarly InterViews and andrew)
are not set up nearly as nice as the rest of X.V11R2.


Then I made "World" & "install".  Then made the links mentioned above.

First try of xinit >& /tmp/mike.tmp produced a screen that looked right, but
there was no text visible in any window.  I could type 'xclock' and get an
xclock window but nothing inside the window.  After exiting I could see an
error message about "RGB_DB could not open" (not exactly the right message).

I suspect something in my symbolic links screws up the automagic makes.  Anyway
typing 'make install' in the directory /lang/X.V11R2/util/rgb fixed the problem.

I'd be real interested if someone has better instuctions on how to install
InterViews.  Andrew was ok after making the changes listed in the README file.

Hope this helps someone...
- mike
