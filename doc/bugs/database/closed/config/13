Subject: makefile bug when no servers are defined

### bug number:   165
### area:         config
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:

	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:

	VAX 11/750

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:

	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:

	>>>NONE<<<

SYNOPSIS:

	imake.rules generates a bad makefile when no servers are defined

DESCRIPTION:

	The 1st line of "make -n" yields:

	case '-n' in *[i]*) set +e;; esac;  for i in ; do  (set -x; install -c  $i /usr/local/x11/bin);  done

	Notice that the line contains a shell for loop which says

		for i in ; do (set -x; ...

	The shell barfs on "for i in ;" complaining

		"syntax error at line 1: ';' unexpected

REPEAT-BY:

	My Vax.macros file contains:

	/* These define the server(s) you want */
	/*#define XqvssServer Xqvss */
	/*#define XqdssServer Xqdss */

FIX:

	I dunno; delete the for loop when no servers are defined?
	Easier perhaps would be to make a "null" server which is
	always there (in the for loop, and in the servers directory)
	whose Makefile just echos something appropriate.
