(Sorry about not using the form, but I can't get at it right now.)

I needed to put the rgb data base in a new location (since we still have some
old servers using the old data base) and figured all I had to do was edit
site.h. Unfortunately, the dix Imakefile overrides what I did by explicitly
using the one from the Imake.tmpl file.

Putting the truth in 2 places hardly ever works. Did I just miss something
in the installation guide?
