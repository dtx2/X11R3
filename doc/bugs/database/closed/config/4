Subject:  Can't make World without any servers
Message-Id:  <8803062327.aa04911@SPARK.BRL.ARPA>

### bug number:   45
### area:         
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Vax 780

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3 BSD

DISPLAY:
	[none!]

SYNOPSIS:
	Can't make World without any servers.

DESCRIPTION:
	On systems without displays where one would still wish
	to build the libraries and client code, if you dont
	define any servers the makefiles bomb (because of
	"for i in $(ALL);" where all is now indefined).  It would
	be nice if one could still do a "make World" etc. on
	such a machine.

REPEAT-BY:
	Don't define any servers and try to do a make depend or
	make install.

FIX:
	Check for $(ALL) defined before the "for i in $(ALL)" lines...
