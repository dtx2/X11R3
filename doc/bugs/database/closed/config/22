Subject: release 2 doesn't compile on RT (with fix)

### bug number:   125
### area:         config
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM RT/PC, IBM 6152

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Academic Operating System 4.3

DISPLAY:
	Any

SYNOPSIS:
	Out of the box release 2 doesn't compile on the RT
	(Release 2 IBM TCS bug #1)

DESCRIPTION:
	The new toolkit, library and some clients in release 2 of X11 don't get
	along at all well with hc.

REPEAT-BY:
	Try to compile release 2 on an RT.

FIX:
	The library breaks because hc is pretty much an ansi compiler, but uses
	an non-ansi preprocessor by default (system files break with the ansi
	preprocessor).   To keep use of ansi features (function prototypes),
	but still get through the preprocessor, we added a define UNIXCPP (It's
	easier, and much shorter to just describe this than include diffs)

[done]    In .../util/imake.includes/Rt.macros, add -DUNIXPCC to the 
	    definition of LibraryDefines and ServerDefines.

[done]    In .../lib/X/Xlibint.h change all occurences of:
	    #ifdef __STDC__
	    to:
	    #if (defined __STDC__)&&(!defined UNIXCPP)

	    In .../extensions/lib/Imakefile, add:
	    STD_DEFINES = LibraryDefines
	    CDEBUGFLAGS = LibraryCDebugFlags

	    In .../extensions/server/Imakefile, add:
	    STD_DEFINES = ServerDefines

[done] The Imakefile in server is incorrect for the RT -- change:
	    #ifdef RtSpecialMalloc
	    to:
	    #ifdef SpecialMalloc
	and add $(SNF) to the list of IBMLIBS after $(DIX)

[???]	The Imakefile in .../server/ddx/ibm/vga is also broken (sorry).
	Change all occurences of setvga to setgraph.

	The toolkit and most clients break hc in ways that don't have a simple 
	workaround, so just compile those components with pcc.
	    I added:
		> #ifdef RtArchitecture
		> CC=pcc
		> #endif
	    to the Imakefiles in:
[done]	.../lib/Xt/Imakefile
[done]	.../lib/Xaw/Imakefile
		.../clients/xterm
		.../clients/xmh
		.../clients/xedit
		.../clients/x10tox11/X11
	    	.../examples/Xaw

	hc chokes on xrdb, but in this case it's easier to change the code.
	In ../clients/xrdb/xrdb.c:
