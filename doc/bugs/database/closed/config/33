VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/280

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	irrelevant

SYNOPSIS:
	make install fails because it doesn't create/check all the
	directories that it needs

DESCRIPTION:
	If DESTDIR is not null, some directories may not exist.
	For example, make install wants to build $(DESTDIR)/usr/include/X11
	but doesn't check if $(DESTDIR)/usr/include exists first.


REPEAT-BY:
	Log in as root.
	Set DESTDIR to something, make sure $(DESTDIR)/usr doesn't exist
	make World >&make.world &
	make install >&make.install &

FIX:
	Fairly trivial; in csh scripts use "if" and the approriate
	special tests for existence and access.  Most DEC VMS/DCL
	scripts are fairly careful about these things; the X release
	should be too.
