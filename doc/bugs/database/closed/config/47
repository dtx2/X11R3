VERSION:
	X11 release 3 beta

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Mac II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	A/UX 1.0

DISPLAY:
	Mac II monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	Certain files in the X source tree have permissions which don't allow
	them to be rcp'ed by normal user.  Others have names longer than 14
	characters, causing problems on System V-based machines.

DESCRIPTION:
	Permissions on the following files do not include read access by everyone.
	The current permission is indicated:

	doc/Xt/Xtk.int.front	440
	doc/Xaw/Xtk.widgets	440
	contrib/xim/xim.c	440
	contrib/xim/traced.Z	600
	contrib/xim/ImageHeader.h	400
	contrib/Xsw/examples/README	640
	contrib/Xsw/lib/SMenu.c		440
	contrib/Xsw/lib/SPDMenu.c	440
	contrib/Xsw/lib/SText.c		440

	The following file names are longer than 14 characters, so they don't
	rcp to a System V-based machine correctly:

	server/ddx/ibm/gen/mpelG_machdep.h
	doc/Server/ddx.doc.tbl.ms.{ps,ps2}
	contrib/Xsw/X11/bitmaps/{highlight_*,select_*}

REPEAT-BY:
	rcp the entire source tree to a System V-based machine.  (I rcp'ed from
	a Vax to a Mac II.)

FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
