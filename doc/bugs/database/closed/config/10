Message-Id:  <8803062326.aa04907@SPARK.BRL.ARPA>

### bug number:   44
### area:         
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	makedepend clashes with some CDEBUGFLAGS

DESCRIPTION:
	makedepend uses some flags of its own which may be
	system cc dependent.  Most notably the sun cc
	command has a -f<floating_point_option> flag which
	if passed to makedepend bombs (since makedepend
	used -f for a makefile spec.

REPEAT-BY:
	On a Sun, add for example -f68881 to CDEBUGFLAGS.
	make dependencies (e.g. make World).

FIX:
	Perhaps a CDEPENDFLAGS should be created which would
	ordinarily be set to CDEBUGFLAGS.  This however would
	allow compiler flags which clash with makedepend
	to be left out of the CDEPENDFLAGS definition.
