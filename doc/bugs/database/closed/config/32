Subject: Documentation and Sun.macros should have SunOS 3.2 warning
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 88 10:23:39 EST

### bug number:   307
### area:         config
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     sun 3.2 warning


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	All Suns running SunOS 3.2


DISPLAY:
	any


AREA:
	config


SYNOPSIS:
	Documentation and possibly configuration stuff should point out that
	SunOS 3.2 has a broken C optimizer.


DESCRIPTION:
	The installation directions, Xsun manual page, and Sun.macros
	files should mention that the C optimizer in SunOS 3.2 is broken
	and that -O should not be used.


REPEAT-BY:
	Compile and run on SunOS 3.2.


FILES:
	doc/releasenotes/*
	server/ddx/sun/README
	server/ddx/sun/Xsun.man
	util/imake.includes/Sun.macros


FIX:
	put comments in the right files (sort of like #ifdef SunOS32).
