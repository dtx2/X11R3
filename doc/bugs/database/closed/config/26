SYNOPSIS:
Make install rebuilds lint library at drop of a hat.  This takes a LONG time.

DESCRIPTION:
I was rebuilding after installing patches 1-11, and noted that the make
install I executed after make is rebuilding the Lint library.  This takes
a LONG time.  I would suggest that the lint library only get rebuilt if
Xlib.h or related header files are later date.  If for some reason an
interface change occurs due to a patch, which strikes me as very
unlikely between releases, one could always arrange to touch Xlib.h.

This problem may not be worth fixing, but it is certainly irritating.

In response to a query to whether it is really worth fixing the
problem I reported earlier on /usr/man not existing, I suspect it
is.  My reasoning is that it is an easy thing to fix, and many
people may run into this problem, as it is natural on machines with
limited disk space to not install man pages.

REPEAT-BY:
Install patches 1-11.  Type "make", become root and type "make install"


FIX:
