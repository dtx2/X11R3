Subject: TCP_NODELAY not being used in 4.2 based servers and Xlibs
Date: Tue, 17 May 88 10:27:57 -0700
From: Phil Karlton <karlton@wsl.dec.com>

### bug number:   503
### area:         config
### severity:     low
### comments:     

Code was carefully added to the libraries and servers to make sure that
TCP connections were running with TCP_DELAY. The code was carefully #ifdef'ed
on TCP_NODELAY so that the function was compilable on multiple systems.
Unfortunately, the header file that defines TCP_NODELAY was never included in
either the server or the library.

It is evident that this was never used since in the library, the variable mi
is not initialized properly to 1, and in the server it is not declared.

I have made changes to server/os/4.2bsd/connection.c, lib/X/Xlibos.h and
lib/X/XconnDis.c. The differences below are my current versions compared to
the sources as distrubuted to R2 and then patched.
