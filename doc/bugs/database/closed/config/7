### status:       closed

Bob,

Gabe and I found that making the new release on our Apollo
DN3000 was pretty straightforward, but ran across a couple
of things that it might be worthwhile for someone up
your way to know.  (Maybe for R3, after they release their
new OS, it'll go as smoothly as on a Sun :-)).  I'll offer
these up over xpert as well.

While I'm at it, let me add my kudos to the others.  I think
the job being done with the X software is superb given the
constraints, and a good model for how to promulgate ideas
(i.e. the X protocol) through the public domain.

Thanks,

Comments on building X11R2 on Apollo DN3000, SR 9.7:

Comments on installing X11 release 2 on Apollo DN3000 SR 9.7.

- Files <sys/fcntl.h> and <sys/sysmacros.h> are asked for but
  missing [I wish I could recall who asked for fcntl.h, since
  that is supposed to be superceded by Xos.h.]

  * Solution: fcntl.h exists in <fcntl.h>.  sys/sysmacros.h doesn't
   seem to be on the Apollo at all (though our Sun has it).
   Create directory ./X11/sys, since all calls to the compiler include
   a switch to look in ./X11.  Stuff the two files (a link suffices
   for fcntl.h) into ./X11/sys/ and all is happy.

- Warning from makedepend on apollo-specific includes in
  ./server/ddx/apollo  for *.ins.c files (#eject directive):
  just a warning, ok to ignore it.

- ./server/ddx/apollo contains clients (tox and todm) that need libX11.a so
  ./lib and ./server cannot completely be made in parallel as
  mentioned in the apollo release notes.  One can make them in
  parallel and then go back and make tox and todm after libX11.a
  exists (the server itself will be fine).

- imake doesn't work on the apollos (due to cpp not working
  properly).  We got around this by using a Sun and NFS, but then
  had to explicitly #undef sun and #define apollo in
  ./util/imake.includes/imake.tmpl (ugly).
