Subject: Re:  R3beta experiences

  Jim:

  I sent the enclosed message to Keith Packard, and I have not 
  had any response yet...  With the expection of minor
  problems, (see below), R3 came up fine on my Sun 3/60C 
  (SunOS 3.5, and SunOS 4.0).  When I tried to bring up R3 
  on a Sun 4/110 (SunOS 4.0) I found that "xterm" dumps
  core.  I am working on this now.

  Keith:

  Thank you for your very prompt delivery of the R3 tape.  I am 
  trying to bring R3 up on Sun 3/60C (SunOS3.5) and Sun 4/110 
  (SunOS4.0) machines.

  I am confused about the change to "server/os/4.2bsd/utils.c".
  This new version of "utils.c" will not allow the old option:

                     -dev /dev/cgfour0

  to get passed to the X server (line 352 calls UseMsg), and 
  therefore, I cannot run on the color frame buffer.  In R2, I 
  started the X server with: 

                     xinit -- -dev /dev/cgfour0

  but this no longer works.  Is there a new method of starting
  X on a color Sun 3/60C?

  Also, please consider changing "server/include/os.h".  On line
  60 there is a statement:

                     #if defined(vax) || defined(sun)

  This should be changed to:

                     #if defined(vax)

  because the Sun X server dosn't use "alloca" and on SunOS4.0
  the "alloca" routine comes up as a unpatched external.
