Subject: lib/X/XConnDis.o should depend on Makefile

### bug number:   1053
### area:         config
### severity:     low
### comments:     

If the Makefile is edited (usually indirectly by editing something like
Vax.macros and remaking the Makefiles) to add or remove something like
DNETCONN, then this file needs to be recompiled. There needs to be a special
rule to enforce this.
