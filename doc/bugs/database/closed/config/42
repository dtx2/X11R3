dont know if this has already been reported yet, but
there is a file IntrinsicI.h that is use in the HP Widgets
toolkit that doesn't show up in the HEADERS directive in
the Makefile.  When "make install" is done, IntrinsicI.h
doesn't get copied/installed in /usr/include/X11 .

Kind of a nit, but thought you would want to know about
it.  Sorry this wasn't in the bug report template format.
