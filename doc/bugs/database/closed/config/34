Subject: source code control system problems

### bug number:   517
### area:         config
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	machine-independent

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	system-independent

DISPLAY:
	display-independent

SYNOPSIS:
	 Use of source code control in distributed files is inconsistent
	 and occasionally troublesome.

DESCRIPTION:
	 when i modify source distribution files (including Imakefiles),
	 i use RCS to track changes that i have made.  this makes it
	 possible for me to apply patches distributed on the network, and
	 to back up to a known version if necessary.

	 Many (but not all) source files distributed under R1 were maintained
	 using RCS by the developers.  others used SCCS.  i propose that the
	 control system be standardized.  also, the $Source$ directive under
	 RCS makes it impossible for me to use 'ci -k' to save the file
	 *exactly* as distributed.  'ci -k' keeps the same version number
	 and author name listed in the source file.  if i can't use 'ci -k',
	 patch will fail on the RCS header when i try to apply a distributed
	 fix.

REPEAT-BY:
	under R2, in directory ./contrib/andrew, try
		% ci -k Makefile

	in any other R2 directory, examine the source files; most do not
	include RCS headers.

FIX:
	choose a standard source code control system for X11, and use it
	consistently.  do not include site-specific fields; under RCS,
	the only line that is necessary is

		$Header$
