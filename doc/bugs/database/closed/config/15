	I started to compile the core.src on the IBM RT and found a problem.
Add the the following lines to the begining of ./lib/X/Xlibint.h to fix the
problem:

#ifdef __STDC__
#undef __STDC__
#endif

	You may want to elaborate the #ifdef further if you are using more
than one architecture for the source. The problem is that hc is an ansi
like compiler but defines the __STDC__ define which is not ansi. This
causes macro expansions in Xlibint.h to use ##'s instead of /**/'s as a
macro spacer.
