VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	fc is not a good name for the font compiler.

DESCRIPTION:
	I humbly suggest that:
	 a) fc be renamed to bdf_to_snf
         b) it be installed in the default bin directory as part of
	    the installation of X.

Why? People do create fonts, and so the tool should be available to
them. However, fc is very likely to conflict with other people's font
compilers or other random programs.
