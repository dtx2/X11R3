VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	hp 9000/350 running hp-ux 6.01

DISPLAY:
	hp 

AREA:
	config

SYNOPSIS:
	There should be a configuration parameter for common link libraries.

DESCRIPTION:
	There should be a parameter in the .macros files that is used by the
	Imake.rules file when linking programs to pass in specific libraries
	to be linked every time.  Although this can be accomplished by setting
	the LDFLAGS parameter, any additional libraries that get passed to the
	SingleProgramTarget, ComplexProgramTarget_1, ComplexProgramTarget_2,
	ComplexProgramTarget_3, or ServerTarget macro function could reference
	libraries that need to be linked in later.

REPEAT-BY:
	Try to set up a library (e.g. a socket emulation library) that
	gets linked into every application last.

FILES:
	util/imake.includes/Imake.rules
	util/imake.includes/*.macros

FIX:
	Create another parameter such as STD_LIBS that defaults to blank
	but which may be set to the names of any libraries to be linked into
	every program last.
