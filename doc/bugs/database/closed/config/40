### bug number:   166
### area:         config
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

While installing release 2 on an HP 9000, I noticed the following
problems:

(1) The program `soelim' which is used during the construction of the
man pages does not exist.

(2) The `bsdinst.sh' shell script is very slow.

I've written and debugged programs which implement both `soelim' and
`bsdinstall' for HP-UX.  The former should run on any un*x, although
the latter will require an hour's work to make it run on something
other than HP-UX.

If you would like the source code (it comes with a Free Software
Foundation copyright) you are welcome.
