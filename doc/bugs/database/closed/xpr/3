			  X Window System Bug Report
			    xbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu




VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    any


DISPLAY:
     any


WINDOW MANAGER:
     n.a. 


AREA:
    xpr


SYNOPSIS:
    xdpp script never gets installed.


DESCRIPTION:
    the Imakefile for xpr never attempts to install the xdpp script, though
    it is clear it should be.  Also, the xpr man page does not reference the
    script.


REPEAT BY:
    inspection


SAMPLE FIX:
    I leave it to Imake hackers, which I'm not particularly good at.
