Probably too late for R2, but for the queues (this may be a repeat).

Do you want this for R2?  Sorry for the late-breaking news.
I can send it to you, or you can pick it up from paris.

Subject: xpr.c bug
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 88 12:38:05 EST
From: Steve Ellis <ellis@ATHENA.MIT.EDU>


    The present version of xpr does not reset the LN03 correctly. This has
2 undesriable effects. First, an extra blank page is "printed" with each
screen dump. The second problem occurs with "lpr", when multipule screen dumps
are in the print queue; the failure to reset properly can cause header
pages to be garbled.

   Updated versions of xpr.c and lncmd.h that fix these bugs are located
in ~ellis/xpr on paris. Also located there are xpr.diffs and lncmd.diffs
showing "diff" results with the Athena X sources on paris.
