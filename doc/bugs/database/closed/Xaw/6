### bug number:   658
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2  Xaw

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Cray-XMP and Cray2

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UNICOS 5.0

DISPLAY:
	sun3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	 Load Widget doesn't work with UNICOS

DESCRIPTION:
	 1.  The kernel name is /unicos
	 2.  the load statistics are in "avenrun"
	 3.  the nlist structure has n_value, not n_type

REPEAT-BY:
	run a test program using a load widget

FIX:
	These aren't really fixes I recommend, but things I did to make
the Load widget work correctly.  The name of the kernel and the symbol
name of the load stats can be put in compile flags in a makefile and
given a default in the source.  The definition of n_value is more of
a problem.
