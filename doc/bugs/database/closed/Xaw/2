Subject: Scrollbars and Color

### bug number:   502
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     very low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Ardent Computer Corp: Titan

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Unix System V.3

DISPLAY:
	Titan Monitor

SYNOPSIS:
	 Scrollbar thumb is allways gray

DESCRIPTION:
	 The scrollbar thumb is drawn using a FillRectangle call with the
	 fill style in the gc set to FillTiled and the tile set to
	 XtGrayPixmap.  Yet there are resources defined to specify the color
	 of the thumb.  Similarly the background is in a different shade of
	 gray.

REPEAT-BY:
	Display any client with an athena scrollbar widget on a color system 
	with the following values in the resource database:

		*ScrollBar: on
		*Scrollbar*background: Green
		*Scrollbar*foreground: Yellow

FIX:
	Draw the thumb using a fill_style of FillStippled or FillOpaqueStippled
	and with the same stipple pattern as that used to construct the gray 
	pixmap.
