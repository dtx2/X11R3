### bug number:   443
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	any color

AREA:
	Xaw

SYNOPSIS:
	Resources for subparts of Text widget have bogus names&classes.

DESCRIPTION:

     Date: Thu, 28 Apr 88 17:00:04 PDT
     From: ardent!mlp@uunet.UU.NET (Mark Patrick)

     I am running xmh on a color system with the following lines in my
     Xdefaults file. 

     *Text*Background: Blue
     *Text*Foreground: White
     *Background: DarkSlateGray
     *Foreground: Green

     This causes the inbox window to be displayed with a blue background and text
     drawn in black on DarkSlateGray.  The buttons are drawn in Green on 
     DarkSlateGray.  Why is the text in the inbox in black?  How do you control
     the color of text in text widgets.

REPEAT-BY:
	Put the above into XENVIRONMENT and run examples/Xaw/xtext

FILES:
	lib/Xaw/AsciiText.c, lib/Xaw/AsciiSink.c

FIX:
	coming.
