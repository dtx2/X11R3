### bug number:   140
### area:         bitmap
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	Will not write the file unless the bitmap is changed.
DESCRIPTION:
	When bitmap is invoked with a file that currently is nonexistant,
	if the first command is a WriteOutput, it is not executed. The 
	file is not created. You must change the grid in some way before
	the WriteOutput command will work. If a user wants to press
	WriteOutput without doing any changes to the bitmap, the write
	should happen. The only time you should check for a changed file
	is when the user wishes to quit, but he/she has not saved away the
	changes.
REPEAT-BY:
	Invoked bitmap with a nonexistant file name. Press WriteOutput
	and Quit. The file was not created.
