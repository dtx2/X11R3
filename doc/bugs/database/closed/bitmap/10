### bug number:   579
### area:         bitmap
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	Plus signs left on grid after move/copy or overlay.
DESCRIPTION:
	Currently when a move/copy or overlay is done, some of the
	destination plus signs can be left on the grid screen. This
	is caused when the cursor is being moved quickly around the
	grid and the destination grid is trying to keep up. The client
	receives a MotionNotify event, removes the plus signs and
	redraws the destination grid at the new x,y. Eventually, a
	ButtonRelease is seen, and the destination grid is overwritten
	with the source, effectively removing the plus signs.

 	What happens is the mouse moves between a MotionNotify and
	ButtonRelease. Therefore the source does not overwrite the
	old destination grid plus signs exactly, leaving extra plus
	signs on the grid.
	
REPEAT-BY:
	Do a move/copy or overlay. Move the destination cursor very
	quickly around the grid. Release the button while moving the
	cursor. It may take several trys to repeat the bug.
