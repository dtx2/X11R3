VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	If the pointer is clicked outside the grid while LINE, CIRCLE
	or FILLED CIRCLE is in effect, the command does not terminate.
DESCRIPTION:
	Currently, all the commands except LINE, CIRCLE and FILLED CIRCLE
	will terminate when the pointer is clicked outside the grid while
	the command is in effect. This is an inconsistancy.
REPEAT-BY:
	Click on LINE, CIRCLE or FILLED CIRCLE. Click the pointer in the
	grid. Click the pointer outside the grid.
