### bug number:   141
### area:         bitmap
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	'bitmap' does not catch an existing file that has a negative height
	or width. Also does not catch extra parameters.
DESCRIPTION:
	If an existing file has a negative height or width declared, 'bitmap'
	does not report an error. The resulting window for 'bitmap' is 
	a wierd size because the client attempt's to use the negative value
	as a dimension.
	If there are extra parameters, they keep being assigned to the
	dimension string. I.E. 'bitmap junk 10x12 4x5'. You will get a bitmap
	4x5.
REPEAT-BY:
	specied a file with the height or width negative.
	'bitmap junk 10x12 4x5'
