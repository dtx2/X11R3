### bug number:   586
### area:         bitmap
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:
	enhancement
DESCRIPTION:
	A bitmap grid can be requested that is larger than the window manager
	will allow. Bitmap goes ahead and uses the space as best it can,
	resulting in command buttons or the image grids becoming clipped or
	just plain missing.

	It has been requested that a message is given in this case, so the
	user can abort the program without waiting for the large grid to be
	drawn, having it cover the entire screen and unable to quit the bitmap
	program via the QUIT button.

	Below is the support for such a message. It is displayed any time the
	window is not large enough for the entire grid, command buttons and
	image grids.
REPEAT-BY:
	<What you did to get the error>
