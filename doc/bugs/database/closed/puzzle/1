VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	amiga 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	amigados

DISPLAY:
	amiga 640x400 monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	Endless loop in ProcessEvent

DESCRIPTION:
	If it recieves a buttonpress event and the window was not
	completely visible it will call XRaiseWindow followed immediately
	by XPutBackEvent. Well, this process has not yet been told that the
	window is now on top so it repeats the process.

REPEAT-BY:
	puzzle
	Iconize it then open it back up. Hit any button on the window
	and it will freeze. It should also freeze if the window is
	partially off screen since it is not ever completely visible.

FIX:
	Kill the XRaiseWindow code by never setting PuzzleOnTop to 0.
