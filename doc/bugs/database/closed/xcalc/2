### bug number:   481
### area:         xcalc
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Prime EXL 316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3

DISPLAY:
	PC XSight

SYNOPSIS:
	 Roll down doesn't work properly in xcalc

DESCRIPTION:
	 The roll down and roll up operations in xcalc are backwards.

REPEAT-BY:
	Press "1", "Enter", "2", "Enter", "3", "Enter", "4", then
	press the "R v" key three times.  You should see "3", "2",
	"1".  Instead you see "1", "2", "3".
