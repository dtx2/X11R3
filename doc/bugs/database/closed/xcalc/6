### bug number:   907
### area:         xcalc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

i find this to be true on my uVAX running 4.3; when my RT is working
(when ibm field circus returns the disk they erroneously took) i'll
see if this is a problem on the IBM platform.

>> Doesn't support the -geometry argument.

the full statement should be "doesn't support the geometry argument
for describing the size of the xcalc."  I can use the -geometry
argument to specify where the xcalc is placed on my display, but I
can't use it to specify the size (although i remember that the manpage
from an earlier version claimed that it didn't make sense to specify
the size of an xcalc ...

I'll forward this to the X people.
