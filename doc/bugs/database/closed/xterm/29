### bug number:   653
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun B&W

SYNOPSIS:
	clients/xterm/termcap has erroneous "status line" entries

DESCRIPTION:
	The "clients/xterm/termcap" file specifies the "hs" capability
	for "xterm", meaning that it's supposed to have a status line.
	Capabilities for moving to and from the status line are also provided.
	But the xterm program itself does not seem to support these
	capabilities.

REPEAT-BY:
	Open an xterm window, log on to a system with the distributed
	xterm entries in its /etc/termcap file and with the "sysline" program,
	run the sysline program, and watch the sysline output show up
	in the middle of your terminal.
