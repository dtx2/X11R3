### bug number:   792
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Ardent Titan

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Unix System V

DISPLAY:
	Titan

SYNOPSIS:
	 problem reading gin requests in xterm tek emulator

DESCRIPTION:
	 On issuing the escape sequence for the gin request nothing is returned
	 until a return is pressed (even when in raw input mode).

	 The other problem was that the values returned are not correct.

REPEAT-BY:
	issued escape sequence for gin request then read 5 characters

FIX:

The Tekproc input routine 'TekEnqMouse' in file clients/xterm/Tekproc.c
seemed to have been reading the mouse position in screen coordinates rather 
than window coordinates. Change this to use window coordinates.


TekEnqMouse(c)
int c;
{
   register TScreen *screen = &term->screen;
   int mousex, mousey, winx, winy;
   unsigned int mask; /* XQueryPointer */
   Window root, subw;

   XQueryPointer(
       screen->display, TWindow(screen),
       &root, &subw,
       &mousex, &mousey,
       &winx, &winy,
       &mask);

   if((winx = (winx - screen->border) / TekScale(screen)) < 0)
      winx = 0;
   else if(winx >= TEKWIDTH)
      winx = TEKWIDTH - 1;
   if((winy = TEKHEIGHT + TEKTOPPAD - (winy - screen->border) /
        TekScale(screen)) < 0)
      winy = 0;
   else if(winy >= TEKHEIGHT)
      winy = TEKHEIGHT - 1;
   TekEnq(c, winx, winy);
}
