Subject: xterm BUG (tek mode reverse video problems)

### bug number:   83
### area:         xterm
### severity:     high
### assigned to:  ralph
### status:       closed

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	SUN 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	 SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	 xterm (Tek) gets confused about background when when xterm
	 is started -rv or when when an xterm (vt) is toggled to
	 reverse video before a Tekwindow is shown.

DESCRIPTION:

	command: xterm -rv -t	/ starts xterm in Tektronix mode,
				  but the background comes up WHITE
				  not BLACK.  The foreground is also WHITE.  

	command: xterm		/ start xterm in VT100 mode,
				  use xterm menu to select reverse
				  video, now select Tek window showing.
				  As above, background of Tektronix window
				  is still WHITE and the foreground as WHITE
				  also.

NOTE: Only Tektronix window exhibits this bug, VT window seems to work Ok.
Also if xterm is started in VT mode without the -rv and Tek window
showing is selected before selecting reverse video then the Tektronix
window background changes correctly.


REPEAT-BY:
	Doing the above.
