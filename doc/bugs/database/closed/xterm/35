SYNOPSIS:
	xterm scrollbar's seem to sometimes get confused if you resize

DESCRIPTION:
	Resizing a window and then scrolling back can sometimes cause it
	to get confused as to what part of the screen should be blt'ed.

REPEAT-BY:
	Turn scrollbars off, resize the window smaller, turn them on, 
	scroll back.  There should be seconds that aren't blt'ed right.
