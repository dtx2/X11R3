### bug number:   801
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110-LC-8 

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS Release 4.0

DISPLAY:
	LC

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm and X entries don't work in the "/etc/ttytab" file. . .

DESCRIPTION:
	. . .even though Sun has adopted a 4.3BSD-style terminal-startup-
	description-file scheme in its 4.0 release.

REPEAT-BY:
	Putting a startup entry in the /etc/ttytab file and turning the
	associated pseudo-terminal on.

FIX:
	The problem is that SunOS 4.0 has moved the "/etc/getty" executable
	to "/usr/etc/getty" without putting a symbolic link to the new
	"/usr/etc" location in the old "/etc" directory.

	One possibility is to warn folks about the problem and instruct them
	to install the symbolic link.

	The other possibility. . .
