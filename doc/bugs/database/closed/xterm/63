Subject: insert character optimization for xterm termcap entry
Message-Id: <777@helios.ee.lbl.gov>
Sender: xpert-request@athena.mit.edu
To: xpert@athena.mit.edu

Description:
	Both the X10 and X11 versions of xterm support the ANSI
	standard IRM (insertion-replacement) mode. Meanwhile, the xterm
	termcap uses insert-character which is not (as) optimal when
	insert-mode is available.

Repeat-By:
	Enter vi and append "foo" to the first line. Position the
	cursor at the beginning of the line. Insert 60 k's using the
	command "60ik\E". Notice that the k's are inserted slowly.

Fix:
	Switch from insert-character to insert-mode; change "ic=\E[@"
	to "im=\E[4h:ei=\E[4l:mi"
