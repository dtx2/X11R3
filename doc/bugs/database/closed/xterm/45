### bug number:   720
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	SIEMENS 9733, Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SINIX 5.2, Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	don't care

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm does wrong refresh.

DESCRIPTION:
	with jumpscroll and scrollarea less then whole screen
	( set by CSI i;j r ) you will get random refresh of the
	areas not scrolled.

REPEAT-BY:
	open xterm(standard size e.g.80x24); set scroll region
	(CSI 2;20r); set jumpscrollmode on; start long output
	(e.g. "ls -lR /" ); force some Refresh cycles ( e.g.
	with uwm, twm ); look at rows <2 and > 21.

FIX:
	assumption:
	Within ScrnRefresh() of module screen.c:
	calculating lastind must depend on row being
	within scrollregion or being out of scrollregion.
	if( row < screen->top_marg || row > screen->bot_marg)
		lastind = row;
	else
		lastint = row - amount;
