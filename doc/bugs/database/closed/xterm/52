### bug number:   591
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
   X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
   Ardent Titan

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
   Unix System V

DISPLAY:
   Titan

SYNOPSIS:
    problem reading gin requests in xterm tek emulator

DESCRIPTION:
    On issuing the escape sequence for the gin request nothing is returned
    until a return is pressed (even when in raw input mode).

    The other problem was that the values returned are not correct.

REPEAT-BY:
   issued escape sequence for gin request then read 5 characters

FIX:

The following routine performs gin input:

#include <stdio.h>

char            gfx[2] = {0x1b, 0x1a};

do_gin(key, x_out, y_out)
   int *key;
   int *x_out, *y_out;
{
   char            buff[5];
   int             j;

   system("stty raw -echo ");

   write(1, gfx, 2);

   for (j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
      buff[j] = getchar();
      if (j == 0)
         write(1, "\r", 1);
   }

   system("stty -raw echo");

   *key = buff[0];
   *x_out = (((buff[1] & 0x1f) << 5) + (buff[2] & 0x1f)) << 2;
   *y_out = (((buff[3] & 0x1f) << 5) + (buff[4] & 0x1f)) << 2;
}

The Tekproc input routine 'TekEnqMouse' seemed to have been reading the 
mouse position in screen coordinates rather than window coordinates. 
Changed this to use window coordinates.
