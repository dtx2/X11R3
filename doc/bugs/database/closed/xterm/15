Subject: overriding xterm "ti" and "te" termcap items
Date: Thu, 10 Mar 88 11:09:11 EST

### bug number:   82
### area:         xterm
### severity:     
### assigned to:  jim
### comments:     The problem is that the te entry has several annoying
###               escape strings in it, including clear screen.  Unfortunately,
###               this requires editting the TERMCAP string....


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	all

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm should have option to ignore "ti" and "te" termcap entries.

DESCRIPTION:
	The xterm termcap items "ti" and "te" generate an escape sequence which
	xterm interprets as "switch-between-screens".  This behavior should be
	selectable as it can be very frustrating.  Forcing the user to edit
	out the strings (since they are present by default in most termcap
	entries) is not appropriate.

REPEAT-BY:
	Start up an xterm whose termcap entry has the "ti" and "te" items.
	Use a program that sends these escape sequences (e.g. less, mg, etc.).
	Exit from the program while still looking at part of the window.
	Be frustrated that xterm has replaced it with what was there before the
	command was invoked.

FIX:
	Add a resource, command line option, and menu choice to select whether
	or not this behavior should be allowed.
