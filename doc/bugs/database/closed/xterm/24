### bug number:   601
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Our port, but could effect other hosts

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	UMIPS-BSD V2.1  (Possibly and non-sun or Ultrix OS)

DISPLAY:
	Color

SYNOPSIS:
	Running xterm, then editing a file with vi would cause the characters
under the cursor to be incorrect, and sometimes the last line would be
duplicated.

DESCRIPTION:
	Vi-ing a file while running xterm caused weird things to happen to
the screen when scrolling occurred.  The problem was traced to a bcopy
call in screen.c in which the source and destination are part of the same
array.  (ScrnInsertLine is where the problem occurred...ScrnDeleteLine
could possibly have a problem as well.)  On our machine, the bcopy had no
stipulation that overlapping copies are handled correctly, and just
copied from source to destination.  One call caused the copied lines to be
duplicated.  (The call that failed was copying 184 bytes from a source
of array location 0, to a destination of array location 2).  The MIPS machine
moves 4 long words at a time.  (An example of what happended is:
   original array (of longwords):		result after first 4 copied:
    source ->	a -					a
		b  | - 4 long words 			b
    dest   ->	c  |	copied				a
		d -					b
		e					c
		f					d
		g					g
		h					h

 When the second 4 words are copied it gets c-d-g-h instead of e-f-g-h.  Working
this through fails even if it copies a byte at a time like bcopy implies.
	
I was told to send this as an application bug, as bcopy does not guarantee that 
overlapping copies can be done on ALL machines...it is just supposed to copy 
from source to destination.  I have tried this on an Ultrix machine and a Sun 
and the copy will take care of the overlap, but not all machines will.

REPEAT-BY:
	Will happen on a mips machine, but since I've looked through the 
bugs reported in bug-trackers, this doesn't seem to be a problem for anyone.

FIX:
	In the ScrnInsertLine routine, have the bcopy call:

	/* move down lines */
	bcopy ((char *) &sb [2 * where], (char *) &sb [2 * (where + n)],
		2 * sizeof (char *) * (last - where));

copy to a tmp variable first, then copy to the destination in the same array.
(Or write a local bcopy routine that would work for all machines.)

Note that ScrnDeleteLine may have the same problem, but it worked correctly
on our machine (with the destination BEFORE the source location in the same
array.)
