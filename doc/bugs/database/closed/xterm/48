Subject: Sun4 compiler bug in xterm/Tekproc.c

### bug number:   727
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     bug in beta test version of Sun Compiler, don't fix X.

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 4

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 4BETA2

SYNOPSIS:
	 C compiler gives compiler error for xterm/Tekproc.c

DESCRIPTION:
	 When compiling xterm, Tekproc.c fails to compile with the 
         following error message:

cc -g -I./../../lib/Xt -I./../.. -DPURDUE -DMODEMENU -DUTMP -c Tekproc.c
"Tekproc.c", line 909: compiler error: no table entry for op =
*** Error code 1

Line 909 is:
       lp->x1 = x1 = x1 * TekScale(screen) + screen->border;

Similar problems occur with the following lines for lp->[xy][12].

REPEAT-BY:
	compile xterm on a Sun4; using make

FIX:
	split the suspect lines so that the multiple assignments are
	done separately:

        x1 = x1 * TekScale(screen) + screen->border;
        y1 = (TEKHEIGHT + TEKTOPPAD - y1) * TekScale(screen) + screen->border;
        lp = line_pt++;
        lp->x1 = x1;
        lp->y1 = y1;

        x2 = x2 * TekScale(screen) + screen->border;
        y2 = (TEKHEIGHT + TEKTOPPAD - y2) * TekScale(screen) + screen->border;
        lp->x2 = x2;
        lp->y2 = y2;
