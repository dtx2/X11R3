### bug number:   593
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2 plus patches up to 33, including
        slave xterm fixes.

CLIENT MACHINE:
 sun 4/280

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
 sunOS Sys4-3.2

DISPLAY:
 Sun 3/50 running SunOS 3.5

SYNOPSIS:
   WINDOWID in the env and the windowid sent back by a slave xterm
are both wrong.

DESCRIPTION:
WINDOWID contains a decimal number that when hexified bears 
no particular resemblance to the windowid reported by xwininfo,
nor to any children reported with -tree. It seems to always be of the 
form 0x1200009 or 0xb00009. IE, it allways ends in 00009.

A perusal of the code shows nothing that sets screen->fullTwin,
which is what is used for this purpose. I may not have looked hard
enough. I find that idea pretty hard to credit, since it would appear
that many other things would bust. Perhaps it is set after 
WINDOWID/the slave line are done?
