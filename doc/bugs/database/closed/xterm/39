There are 3 pieces of information:

	icon_name	hint for wm to use in icons
	window_name	hint for wm to use in title bars and placement prompts
	appl_name	application resource name

appl_name always exists.  It comes from argv[0] or from -name.

icon_name should normally default to window_name if there is one, or to
appl-name otherwise.

window_name should normally default to icon_name if there is one, or to
appl_name otherwise.

xterm wants icon_name and window_name to be the same.  In addition, it
wants them to be "login(host)" if it is a login xterm, "command-to-exec"
if it got a -e argument, or "title" if it got a -T argument.  It also
wants to append '(Tek)' if defaulted to appl_name.  Other piece
of trivia: xterm had a -n option whose semantics were to set the icon name.
Unfortunately, this is an abbreviation for -name which has entirely different
semantics, so users are guaranteed to get confused.  That's why I re-sorted
the options table in xterm/main.c

Obviously, the order of assignment is important.  My quick test using xprop
to figure out what's really going on leads me to believe that the following
are doing the right thing:

	xterm -n foo
	xterm -name foobar
	xterm -xrm '*iconName:foo'
	xterm -n foo -T butwhat
	xterm -xrm '*iconName:foo' -T butwhat

however,

	xterm -name foobar -T butwhat

gets an icon_name of 'foobar' where it should really be 'butwhat'.

The Tek rules should follow from the above.
