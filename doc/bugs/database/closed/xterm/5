Version;

Synopsis:
	The arglist in CreateScrollBar in scrollbar.c explicitly forces
	several attributes that should be left for retrieval from the
	resource database.  In particular, the width (thickness) is
	#defined, so that the computation of the total window width can
	be simplified.  Until the much-needed rewrite happens, we
	should at least drop the #define and query the width after
	creating the scrollbar, caching it as now so the various column
	computations don't have to be modified.
