### bug number:   772
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2, patchlevel 10

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60 and Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun B&W.

SYNOPSIS:
	If given a title as a command line argument as well as a
command, xterm titles its window with the command name, not the title.

DESCRIPTION:
	If given a title via -title as well as a command to execute
via -e, xterm will set the window's title to the command's name
instead of the explicitly given title. 'xterm -title <whatever>'
without a command works, as does setting the window title with escape
sequences after the window has opened up. Setting the title via '-T'
works fine, however.

REPEAT-BY:
	xterm -title hiho -e vi /etc/termcap
