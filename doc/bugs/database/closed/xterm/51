### bug number:   724
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50, Sun 3/60, Sun 3/110, Sun 4/110, Sun 3/260

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.3, SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	bw2, cg2, cg4

SYNOPSIS:
	Tektronix mode doesn't work in reverse video unless the xterm 
	is started without reverse video.

DESCRIPTION:
	The core class widget used for obtaining the foreground color
	doesn't process reverse video resource. So the Tek draws white on
	white. If it (tek mode) is started in normal video, and then
	reversed, it works fine.

REPEAT-BY:
	Start up a tek xterm with
		xterm -rv -t
	Try to do anything.

FIX:
	I'm not sure if the X Toolkit should be fixed to reverse foreground
	and background when the -rv resource is set.

	For now, a simple fix to xterm solves most of the problem. (Things
	are still strange if you start up a vt100 xterm in normal video, then
	reverse it, and then select Tek mode from the menu. The tek and
	vt100 maintain opposite background, but are still visible.
