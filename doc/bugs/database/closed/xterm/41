VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun 3/50

SYNOPSIS:

	When using the -e flag with xterm you can't specify the icon
	name with -n.

	When using the -e flag with xterm you can't specify the icon
	name with -n.  The icon name is always set to the command
	specified with -e.

		xterm -i -n boofer -e telnet

FIX:

	This is a guess:

	main.c:

	472d471
	< 		{XtNiconName, NULL},
	495c494
	< 		args[0].value = args[1].value = (XtArgVal)window_title;
	---
	> 		args[0].value = (XtArgVal)window_title;
	498c497
	< 		args[0].value = args[1].value =
	---
	> 		args[0].value =
