### bug number:   578
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	all

DISPLAY:
	all

AREA:
	xterm

SYNOPSIS:
	The pointerShape resource is declared wrong; also, xterm bashes the
	pointerShape resource so people can't override it.

DESCRIPTION:
	The definition of pointerShape in charproc.c is bogus (note the 
	sizeof(Cursor) for a resource that is of type XtRString).  Also,
	various places in the code explicitly check the string and build
	a cursor using hardwired patterns.

REPEAT-BY:
	Eyeball the code; try xterm -xrm "XTerm*pointerShape: gumby"


FILES:
	./clients/xterm/charproc.c	bad use of misc.curs_shape
	./clients/xterm/misc.c		the make_xterm and make_arrow routines
	./clients/xterm/util.c		bad use of misc.curs_shape
