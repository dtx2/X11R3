Subject: xterm (X11R2) has no documented option to disable utmp munging
Us-Snail: 64 Dudley St., Brookline, MA
Zip-Code: 02146

### bug number:   623
### area:         xterm
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	vax

DISPLAY:
	qdss

AREA:
	xterm

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm always mangles /etc/utmp

DESCRIPTION:

	X11R2 xterm does not allow the user to specify that it should not
	futz with /etc/utmp.  I don't want it putting entries into my
	/etc/utmp, and I currently need to use a setuid program to get rid
	of the entries it fabricates.

	xterm should have a command-line option and a resource flag to
	prevent it from adding entries into /etc/utmp.
