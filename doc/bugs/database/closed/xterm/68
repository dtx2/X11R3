Subject: Xterm bug report

### bug number:   1023
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     temporary fix is to remove status line from sample termcap


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun-3/160, Monochrome

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 4.0

DISPLAY:
	bwtwo0

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm doesn't support status line yet its termcap entry claims to

DESCRIPTION:
	xterm's termcap entry claims to support a status line, with some
    suitable escape sequences provided to enter the status line, exit the
    status line, disable the status line, etc.

	When running the 4BSD `sysline' program which makes use of this feature,
    xterm steadfastly ignores the escape sequence to enter the status line,
    which is `<ESC>[?E<ESC>[?%i%dT' ("<ESC>" indicating escape).

REPEAT-BY:
	Run `sysline' inside xterm.  The sysline output is properly put into
    reverse video, but is not put on a status line or at the bottom of the
    screen.

FIX:
	Unknown.  xterm's too big for me to grovel through ...

COMMENT:
    Of course, my xterm loses it's cookies whenever I try to select
    Tektronix mode showing, so maybe my xterm is broken.
