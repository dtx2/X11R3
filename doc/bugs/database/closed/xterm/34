X11R2 xterm, Sun 3.5

As a Symbolics refugee, I really miss the ability to modify ALL of the Xterm
parameters (include log target and history depth) from within the xterm.
I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know.
I would settle for commands that communicated with the current window via
a socket with an agreed upon name, though on consideration that won't really
work.
