### bug number:   334
### area:         xterm
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       closed
### comments:     duplicate of several other reports

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VaxStation 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	 xterm doesn't honor '-ls' (login shell) option

DESCRIPTION:
	 When the command line option '-ls' is given, according to the
	 man page it should start up a shell in such a way that it
	 executes '.profile'.  In Relese 1, this worked.  In release 2,
	 due to the new processing of options using the toolkit, this
	 doesn't work any more.

REPEAT-BY:
	Put something like "echo Hello world" in your .profile (or
	.login for csh users).
	Execute 'xterm -ls'.
	Note that the .profile or .login is not executed.

FIX:
	in clients/xterm/main.c, after
	  if (term->misc.scrollbar)	screen->scrollbar = SCROLLBARWIDTH;
	(line 465) add
	  if (term->misc.login_shell)	login_shell= 1;
