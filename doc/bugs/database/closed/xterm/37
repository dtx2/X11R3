There appears to be a bug in X11R2 xterm's handling of the DECCOLM (change
from 132 to 80 columns or vice versa) escape sequence.  If xterm is invoked
with the `-132' option then the window does indeed respond to the DECCOLM
escape sequence and resize from 80x24 to 132x24.  Unfortunately, however,
text is wrapped at 80 columns!  I have tried a number of fixes, none of which
have been successful and I'm not (yet) enough of an X hacker to understand
what's going on.

One workaround that I have found is to manually fiddle with the window size
after entering 132 mode.  After the resulting resize event has been seen
by the window everything seems fine.  Unfortunately, and very curiously,
however, switching into 132 mode seems to cause xterm to lose cognisance of
the screen size in characters and it reports the resizing information in
pixles instead!

Has anyone else come across this/fixed this problem?
