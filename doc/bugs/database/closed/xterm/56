VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VaxStation 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	 xterm draws its 'open rectangle' cursor at the wrong place

DESCRIPTION:
	 With certain fonts, the 'open rectangle' cursor drawn when the
	 window doesn't own the keyboard comes out at the wrong place.

REPEAT-BY:
	Install font 'courier12f' from the Andrew distribution;
	then try 'xterm -fn courier12f' and move the mouse into and out
	of the window.

FIX:
	In "charproc.c", function ShowCursor, line 2171, change
	  screen->box->x = x + screen->fnt_norm->max_bounds.lbearing;
	into
	  screen->box->x = x;
	(This worked for me; I don't really know why it was there though!)
