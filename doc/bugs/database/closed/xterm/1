VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
        Sun 3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	BW2

SYNOPSIS:
         The '-ls' option to xterm does not cause the shell started in the
	 xterm window to read the .login file.

DESCRIPTION:
	 Our standard environment is set up such that we pass the '-ls' 
	 option to the login xterm forked by xinit.  When it is read a
	 second time, .login starts up the window manager, other xterm 
         processes, etc.  When I first brought up release 2, I noticed that 
         .login was not being read again even though xterm had been passed
         the '-ls' option.  I traced this to a problem with xterm itself.

REPEAT-BY:
	 Starting xterm with the '-ls' option and seeing whether it reads 
         the .login file.

FIX:
        In clients/xterm/main.c, the variable login_shell is tested to see
	if a  '-' should be prepended to the shell name which would cause the
        .login file to be read by the shell.  This test is found on line
	1262:
		execlp (ptr,  login_shell ? shname_minus : shname, 0);

	The problem  is that 'login_shell' is never assigned a value after
	it is  declared.  In release 2 the variable 'term->misc.login_shell'
        indicates whether the '-ls' option was specified.  Therefore, line
	1262 should  be changed to:

      	   execlp (ptr, term->misc.login_shell ? shname_minus : shname, 0);

        When I made this fix on my machine, the problem went away.
