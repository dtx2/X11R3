VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VAX

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.2,

DISPLAY:
	GPX

SYNOPSIS:
	 If -e is speicified, the -n switch is ignored unless the -T is
	also specified.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The logic in main.c that is trying to figure out what to name
	the main  window as well as the icon name seems to be dependent
	on command_to_exec. I suspect mostly the test
        	if ((get_ty || command_to_exec) && !title) {
	It seems that iconName should be treated similarly to title.


REPEAT-BY:
	Try "xterm -n foo -e sh".

FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
