			  X Window System Bug Report

VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    Sun 3/50 running SunOS 3.2


DISPLAY:
    Sun monchrome


WINDOW MANAGER:
    uwm


AREA:
    xterm


SYNOPSIS:
     vi does not know about window size when executed in an
     xterm window.


DESCRIPTION:
    The window size parameters, COLUMN and LINES, are not set
    with the X11R3 version of xterm.  This setting is done in
    two places - main.c and screen.c.  The code in screen.c
    works correctly to handle resize of a window.  The code
    in main.c sets the window size of file descriptor screen->request,
    and then closes this file.


REPEAT BY:
    Bring up xterm.  Execute vi.  The text scrolls off the top of the
    screen.  Can also be repeated by running the test program:
---------------------------
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
main()
{
	struct ttysize ts;
	ioctl(0,TIOCGSIZE, &ts);
	printf("%d %d\n",ts.ts_lines, ts.ts_cols);
}
---------------------------
    When xterm first comes up, the window size is "0 0".  After
    a resize, it indicates the correct size.

    [can also use stty -everything]
