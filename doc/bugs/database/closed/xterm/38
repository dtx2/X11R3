### bug number:   656
### area:         xterm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun B&W

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm doesn't handle \E[?3h and \E[?3l correctly.

DESCRIPTION:
	The xterm window resizes, but xterm's notion of the last column to use
	doesn't change.

REPEAT-BY:
	Open an xterm window specifying the -132 option, then type in
		awk 'BEGIN { printf "%c[?3h", 27 ; exit }'
	Note that the window properly widens.  Then type in characters
	and note that wrapping still takes place at column 80.

FIX:
	Will require some study, unless a wiser hand knows the fix.
