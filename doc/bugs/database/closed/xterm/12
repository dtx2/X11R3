VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	any machine

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any os

DISPLAY:
	any display

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm uses a class name of "XTerm" instead of "Xterm"

DESCRIPTION:
	Sigh, xterm isn't consistent with the class naming scheme.  According
	to the conventions, the instance name "xterm" is considered one word
	since the "t" is in lower case.  Therefore, the class name should be
	"Xterm", not "XTerm".

REPEAT-BY:
	Look at main.c, try to create resources of class "Xterm", lose.

FILES
	clients/xterm/main.c

FIX:
	Break existing resource files by correcting the name in the call to
	XtInitialize() around line 322 in main.c.
