VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4 (if it matters: 16" FC display)

SYNOPSIS:
	Xsun does not switch between the mono and color screens for CG4

DESCRIPTION:
	According to the Xsun man page, you should be able to slide
	the mouse off the edge of the screen and swap color and mono
	screens for the CG4. When I try to slide my mouse off the
	screen, the cursor just goes to the edge and stops.

	I start my server with "-dev /dev/cgfour0" option as
	recommended by the server/ddx/sun/README. 

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
	I leave it to you guys
