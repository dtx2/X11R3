I'm having some problems installing X11 Rel 2 on my Sun 3/50 (3.2) - 
Can you help???

I want to bring up X11 from xinit, but when I use the script below the program
falls over, complaining about a broken pipe.  (If I just run the server on its
own by calling Xsun directly, it seems to be happy).

Start-up script:
---------------

#!/bin/csh
setenv DISPLAY unix:0
exec /usr/bin/X11/xinit /usr/bin/X11/xterm =80x24+647+0 -C -n console -- -a 1


The steps I have taken to install X11 are as follows:

(1) Placed the source code in /usr/src/local/X11
(2) Typed make. (No complaints)
(3) Typed make install, as root. (No complaints)
(4) Made /etc/X a link to /usr/bin/X11/Xsun
(5) Added /usr/bin/X11 to my $PATH

Thanks
