Subject: X11 R2 bug report: Bad class names for some clients

### bug number:   1072
### area:         misc
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     We didn't fix this before because it would break a lot of 
###               people's environments.  Unless there are overwhelming calls
###               for this sort of change to be made, we aren't going to do
###               anything about it.

--------------------
VERSION:
	X11 release 2 with fixes 1-215 applied

CLIENT MACHINE:
	any

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	any

SYNOPSIS:
	some clients and contribs that use Xtk give bad names or classes

DESCRIPTION:
	The bug that Jim found in xterm (MIT # 201) is in many clients
	that use the toolkit.  Many class names are not capitalized
	properly, others are completely bogus.  This bug should not have
	been rejected - its correctness has been extensively discussed on
	the net.  People should be well aware that the class names are
	messed up in R2 - we fixed our Xterm in anticipation of this bug
	being fixed. We need a documented convention on capitalization 
	style for client class names.  Please let us know your intentions 
	in this matter.

REPEAT-BY:
	mental excercise

FIX:

	Only the first letter of the application class name should be
	capitalized, i.e.  Xterm, not XTerm.  The inconsistency in this
	convention makes the class names unusable by mere mortals, so
	some of them must be fixed.  Pick some convention, publish it,
	and stick to it.

Here are all (mostly bad) XtInitialize calls in R3 clients and contribs:

clients:

xbiff/xbiff.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize ("main", "XBiff", options, XtNumber (options),
xclock/xclock.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize("main", "XClock", options, XtNumber(options), &argc, argv);
xedit/xedit.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize( "xedit", "Xedit", NULL, 0, &argc, argv);
<<<< OK!
xload/xload.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize("main", "XLoad", options, XtNumber(options), &argc, argv);
xlogo/xlogo.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize("main", "XLogo", NULL, 0, &argc, argv);
xman/main.c:  top_menu = XtInitialize(TOPBOXNAME,"XMan", 
xmh/init.c:    toplevel = XtInitialize("main", "Xmh", table, XtNumber(table),
xterm/main.c:   standard XtInitialize options now */
xterm/main.c:	toplevel = XtInitialize("xterm", "XTerm",

contrib:
