VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE: Sun 3/110

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 4.0

DISPLAY: BW2

SYNOPSIS:
	trying to get a hardcopy of an X-window which is slightly off screen
	results in an error.

DESCRIPTION:
	Using a script like
	
	xwd -xy | xpr $* -compact -device ps | ...

	and pointing to a window which is slightly off the screen
	results in the error message:

X Protocol error detected by server: parameter mismatch
  Failed request major op code 73 X_GetImage
  Failed request minor op code 0 (if applicable)
  ResourceID 0x200061 in failed request (if applicable)
  Serial number of failed request 13
  Current serial number in output stream 13
  xpr: premature end of file
xpr: file format version missmatch.
 
	... and no hardcopy.

REPEAT-BY:
	see above

FIX:
	move window by one pixel.  Permanent fix should grab the portion which
	is on the screen and just print that.
