Subject: resize to resize a window

### bug number:   998
### area:         xterm
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

In X10 the resize command was able to resize a window to the
specifications given on the command line.  In X11.R2 it says:

	resize: Can't set window size under VT100 emulation

Will X11.R3 allow this?  The command I'm using is:

	 rs 132 64

where rs is defined as:

	set noglob; eval `resize !*`; unset noglob

Thanks.

Jeff
