### bug number:   232
### area:         xwd
### severity:     low
### comments:     Not only does the program write out XColor structures as a
###               whole, it also writes its header out as one large chunk.
###               It also makes assumptions about the layout of the subfields
###               within the XColor struct (note how it swaps the gun values:
###               it does a swapshort of 3, starting at red)

Subject: xwd file format

I've been looking at the format of the bitmap files produced by xwd.
The header is described in XWDFile.h, and it's all nice and machine-
independent.  But if you look at xwd.c, you will find that it writes
out XColor structs directly.  This doesn't seem very portable -- the
actual size of this struct could vary from compiler to compiler.
Since xwd goes to great lengths to be machine-independent, this seems
weird.

Can someone who knows more about it than I do comment on whether the
XColors should be translated to 32-bit xwdvals before they are written
out?  Naturally this would mean bumping the XWD_FILE_VERSION.
