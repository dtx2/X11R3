Subject:        Xcalc bug

### bug number:   478
### area:         xcalc
### severity:     very low
### comments:     hp mode in general is VERY messed up

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Prime EXL 316

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3

DISPLAY:
	PC XSight

SYNOPSIS:
	 There are stack problems with xcalc in HP mode

DESCRIPTION:
	 Pushing numbers onto the stack in HP mode, doesn't
	 work properly.  Numbers sumtimes get double entered
	 on the stack.

REPEAT-BY:
	 Press "1", "Enter", "2", "Enter", "3", "Enter", "4",
	 then roll down the stack with the "R v" key.  It will
	 display "2", "3", "3", "4".  It should display, "1",
	 "2", "3", "4".

FIX:
	The following will fix the described problem.  However,
	I am not sure that it doesn't break something else yet.
