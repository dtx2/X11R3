Subject: text widget

### bug number:   764
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     


The text widget handles tabs wrong.  That is, it doesn't quite
correspond to a typical 8-space tab setting, for example, that used by
xterm.  Look at cases of seven characters followed by tab, compare
with tty output.

This text:

Type:		VAX		<= using tabs for columnation
Serial:		WF71105447
Problem:	Needs Software

Has the "WF..." one tab column further right in the displayed widget.

The code in AsciiSink.c
    if (c == '\t')
        /* This is totally bogus!! need to know tab settings etc.. */
	return data->tabwidth - (x % data->tabwidth);
should probably be something like:
    if (c == '\t')
	/* This is still bogus! */
	return 1+ data->tabwidth - ((x - 1) % data->tabwidth);

(This is a completely untested guess, though....)
