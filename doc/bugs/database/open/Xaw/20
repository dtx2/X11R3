VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	MASSCOMP 5400

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	RTU (Unix)

DISPLAY:
	GA1000

SYNOPSIS:
	When a label widget is resized, you sometimes wind up with the label
	string "double-printed".

DESCRIPTION:
	When a label widget is resized, it sometimes recalculates the label
	y position in a manner that is inconsistent with the way the server
	moves the widget's window contents under the influence of center
	bit gravity.  This results in the server moving the label string
	and then the label widget's repainting the string one pixel lower on
	the screen.  The result is looks like seeing double (except vertically).

REPEAT-BY:
	Run the xwidgets toolkit example and reposition the border below
	the "at least one of everything!" label widget.  If you do this a
	couple of times, each time moving it down one pixel, you will eventually
	see this effect.

FIX:
	A simple minded fix I did was to add an XClearWindow call to the
	Redisplay routine in the label widget (Xaw/Label.c).  I didn't see
	any other way around it because the server calculates the new y
	position of data for resized windows by halving the height change
	and adding it to the old y value, but the label widget Resize function
	calculates a new y by halving (widget height - label height).  Round
	off effects in the two situations are different and, in general,
	not related:  whether the height change is odd has no bearing on
	whether (widget height - label height) is odd.
