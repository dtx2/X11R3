### bug number:   567
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:   X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:   Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:   4.3bsd

DISPLAY:   GPX

SYNOPSIS:   When forcebars is True, the widget tries to create 2 horizontal
    scrollbars instead of one horizontal and one vertical scrollbar.

DESCRIPTION:   I didn't actually observe this behavior, since I noticed this
    bug when I was reading Viewport.c to try to get the forcebars to
    work.  In the viewport's Initialize procedure, the following two
    lines are intended to create the horizontal and vertical scrollbars
    for the forcebars option.

    if (w->viewport.allowhoriz)
        clip_args[1].value = (XtArgVal)CreateScrollbar(w, True);
    if (w->viewport.allowvert)
        clip_args[0].value = (XtArgVal)CreateScrollbar(w, True);
                                  ~~~~
    CreateScrollbar's second argument is the Boolean variable
    "horizontal".  If CreateScrollbar is called twice with this set
    to True, then two horizontal scrollbars have been created.

FIX:    Change the second call to:

    if (w->viewport.allowvert)
        clip_args[0].value = (XtArgVal)CreateScrollbar(w, False);
