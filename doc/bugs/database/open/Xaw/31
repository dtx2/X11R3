### bug number:   884
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

Has anyone investigated the weird behaviour of tab stops in Xedit?
I find that the first stop on a line is ~ 5 characters, and the rest ~ 8
chars.  (Well actually this applies to any Text widget that has a
scrollbar down the left edge -- the difference between 5 and 8 chars
looks very like the width of the scrollbar so presumably something
is forgetting to subtract something somewhere...)

This is probably dead easy to fix given the above clue but I just
don't have the time right now.  Has anyone already looked into this?
