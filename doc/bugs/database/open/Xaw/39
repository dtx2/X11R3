### bug number:   1093
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Sun OS 3.2

DISPLAY:
	Sun monochrome

SYNOPSIS:
	Label widget doesn't update when sensitivity changes until subsequent
	action causes redisplay.

DESCRIPTION:
	The Label.c SetValues() function only returns a non-zero value (indicating
	redisplay required) when the widget is resized. If a SetValues() call
	merely changes the sensitivity, the widget is not redisplayed reflecting
	the sensitivity change.

REPEAT-BY:
	Look at the code or write a simple experiment where some action changes
	a Label widget's sensitivity after it is realized.

FIX:
	Here is the diff between the original SetValues() return statement and
	the fixed one:

385c385
<     return( was_resized );
---
>     return( was_resized || XtIsSensitive(curlw) != XtIsSensitive(newlw));
