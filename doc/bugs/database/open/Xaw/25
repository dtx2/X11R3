Subject: Bug in X toolkit (XV11R2)
Us-Snail: 64 Dudley St., Brookline, MA
Zip-Code: 02146

### bug number:   767
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	VAXstation II/GPX running 4.3BSD + NFS

DISPLAY:
	Digital QDSS, 8 plane

AREA:
	X toolkit

SYNOPSIS:
	When resizing widgets using Grips (?), the dividing line is
	redrawn in the foreground color, not the border color.  When the
	dividing line is re-exposed via some kind of exposure event, it is
	correctly drawn in the border color.

DESCRIPTION:
	This appears in xman.

REPEAT-BY:
	Bring up an Xman on a color display with foreground color !=
	border color.  Select "Both Shown" mode.
	Resize the manual page display area by dragging the grip box up
	or down.  Notice the wrong color.
	Pop up a menu by moving the mouse into the "Directory of: ..."
	box.  Move out of the window, and note the correctly colored refresh.
