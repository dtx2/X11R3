Subject: XtDiskSourceDestroy doesn't close file

### bug number:   611
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60C

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	cgfour0

SYNOPSIS:

	The XtDiskSourceDestroy is not releasing (closing) the associated file
	descriptor.  The maximum number of file descriptors is soon reached,
	an no more windows can be opened.

DESCRIPTION:

	Under the SunOS 3.4 operating system there is a limit of 30 file
	descriptors that can be opened simultaneously.  With larger applications
	that opens many windows (and hence, many widgets), together with the file
	descriptors used by the application programs, the 30 file descriptor
	limit is easily exceeded.  In SunOS 4.0 this limit is increased to 64,
	but this still may be a problem.

	The routine "fstat" showed that file descriptors were not being released
	by the destroy callback widget.  By putting a "fclose" in the
	XtDiskSourceDestroy routine, this released the file descriptor and solves
	the problem.

REPEAT-BY:
	-
