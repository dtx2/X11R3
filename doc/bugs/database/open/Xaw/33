### bug number:   988
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     anybody care to supply code...

VERSION:
	X11 release 3 (pre-release)
SYNOPSIS:
	Some Xaw widgets don't honor the "reverseVideo" option. Note that
	although their documentation doesn't claim that they do (thus the
	code and documentation agree - no bug), it is desirable to make
	all widgets honor the option symmetrically.
DESCRIPTION:
	Configuration:
		server:	Sun 3/50, SunOS3.2
		client: Symmetry S81, Dynix 3.0.12

	The following widgets DO NOT honor the "reverseVideo" option:
	    AsciiSink.c
	    Command.c
	    GrayPixmap.c
	    Label.c
	    List.c
	    Text.c
	    VPaned.c

REPEAT-BY:
	Look at the code; fire up "examples/Xaw/xwidgets -reverse".
