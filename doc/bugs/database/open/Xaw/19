### bug number:   759
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

I would like another resource to be added that would cause the plot to move
over only one pixel at a time rather than jumping half the width of the window
when the right edge oveflows.

This would leave the maximum amount of information on the screen and would
make it suitable for other uses.
