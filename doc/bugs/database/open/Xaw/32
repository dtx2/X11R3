### bug number:   933
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     



VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	 xmore does not support standard cut and paste mouse clicks

DESCRIPTION:
	 Many times, one looks through a file to retrieve some information.
	 One would then like to transfer this info to another place using
	 cut-and-paste.  The ``added feature'' that lets mouse clicks in
	 the text scroll the window is unecessary, and prevents the program
	 from using standard cut-and-paste mouse sequences.  Scrolling
	 should be left to the scroll bar.

	 I presume this goes as well for anything else using the
	 ScrollByLine widget.
