Subject: uninit variable in lib/Xaw/Box.c

### bug number:   569
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/75 (but doesn't matter)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	SUN

SYNOPSIS:
	uninitialized variable in Box.c causes its width or heigh to
	be incorrectly reset

DESCRIPTION:
	In the query_geometry function of the Box widget (PreferredSize) 
	a return is done before the preferred->request_mode variable is
	set.  Since this is a stack variable, the value can be
	anything.  The calling function (XtQueryGeometry) then uses
	this value to decide which values have been changed, which
	will cause it to change things that really shouldn't be.
	Example, if the value on the stack happened to make
	(value & CWWidth) true, then the width of the box will be
	changed to whatever was in the width slot on the stack (in
	this case 214444444).

REPEAT-BY:
