From: davy@riacs.edu

### bug number:   1048
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     
### comments:     probably fixed by ralph's new Scrollbar widget interface


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sequent Balance series

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Dynix 3.0.n

DISPLAY:
	Anything (we rsh our xterms over to the Sequent to display on Suns).

SYNOPSIS:
	When running xterm on a sequent, pressing the middle button in the
	scroll bar (the "thumbwheel") causes xterm to take an arithmetic
	exception and dump core.

DESCRIPTION:
	The NotifyThumb routine from the Xaw scrollbar widget passes a
	float to the callback routine in xterm, ScrollTextTo.  But since
	the XtCallCallbacks routine declares the call data as a caddr_t,
	things get all hosed up on a Sequent, since you can't stuff
	floats into char *'s and vice versa.

	This is going to cause problems on any machine where caddr_t
	is not the catch-all type.  I don't have a SPARC machine to
	test it on, but I suspect you might have this problem there,
	too.

	I would suggest making the callback stuff pass a union around
	instead of a caddr_t, and putting things like float, long, and
	char * into the union.  This would be a lot more portable.
	Actually doing this of course, is left as an exercise. :-)

REPEAT-BY:
	Run an xterm on a Sequent, and press the middle mouse button in
	the scrollbar.  Watch it dump core.

FIX:
	NOTE: This fix is a KLUDGE.  I didn't feel like going through the
	entire toolkit changing the caddr_t to something else, nor did I
	feel like finding everything that uses the scrollbar widget and
	fixing them to use a pointer to a float or whatever.

	My fix was simply to make the NotifyThumb routine pass a long
	instead of a float, by taking the original float and multiplying
	by 1000000.0.  Then, in xterm, I changed ScrollTextTo to take
	the long and divide by 1000000.0, giving a float again.

	Diffs for src/lib/Xaw/Scroll.c and src/clients/xterm/scrollbar.c
	are enclosed below, separated by a line of "#"s.
