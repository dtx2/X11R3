Subject: bug in Box Widget Layout + fix for it

### bug number:   843
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     low
### comments:     

 
Folks,
 
	There is a bug in the DoLayout routine associated with the Box Widget. It 
calculates the height required for the box on  the basis of one line per child
even while positioning multiple children on each line. 
 
The "diff"erence between the original file ( <Xdir>/core/lib/Xaw/Box.c ) and
the fixed file is :
 
165c165
< 	    if ((lw + bw > w /* idth */) && (lw > h_space)) {
---
> 	    if ((lw + bw > width) && (lw > h_space)) {
 
cheers,
