Subject: text widget very slow
Date: Sat, 08 Oct 88 10:15:49 EDT

### bug number:   1062
### area:         Xaw
### severity:     high
### comments:     


VERSION:
    R3beta

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    Sun

DISPLAY:
    Visual X terminal, Tektronix 4317

AREA:
    Xaw

SYNOPSIS:
    Text widget echos typed text very slowly in xmh.

DESCRIPTION:
    The text widget cannot keep up with my typing sometimes,
drawing characters about 4 per second.  At other times, it
works just fine (more than twice as fast).  It this caused because
the scrollbar is redrawn (apparantly) for each character typed?  The
speed is proportional to the width of the window and to the
length of the document.

REPEAT BY:
    Compose messages in xmh, notice wide variation in speed.
