VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	MASSCOMP 5400

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	RTU (Unix)

DISPLAY:
	GA1000

SYNOPSIS:
	Using the middle button option to move a pane border in a vertically
	paned widget can sometimes cause the application to hang.

DESCRIPTION:
	When a pane border is moved below the lower border for the next lower pane
	or above the border for the next upper pane, the application hangs
	(doesn't accept mouse input).

REPEAT-BY:
	Run the xwidgets toolkit example and use the middle mouse button to
	reposition the border below the "ok" button widget.  If you move it
	below the bottom border of the next lower pane (the one with the "label"
	and "command" buttons), you will see this effect.

FIX:
	The VPaned widget code is difficult to decipher without comments, but
	I suspect it's getting stuck in one of the loops in RefigureLocations.
