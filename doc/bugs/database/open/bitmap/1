SYNOPSIS:
    bitmap -nodashed set area inverts region including grid


DESCRIPTION:
    If you run bitmap in "no-dashed" mode and a "Set Area", the grid will
    be inverted as well as the indicated squares.  If you then clear some
    of these squares, the grid will be missing.

	Set Area
	clear a square


SAMPLE FIX:
    redraw the grid in the area that was just drawn.
