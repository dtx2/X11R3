VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/110-LC-8

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS Release 4.0

DISPLAY:
	cgfour

SYNOPSIS:
	Function libraries and lint libraries are created inconsistently.

DESCRIPTION:
	When you "make install" after you "make World", you end up with
	6 function libraries in "/usr/lib" but only five lint libraries
	in "/usr/lib/lint".  /usr/lib/lint/llib-lX.ln is missing.
