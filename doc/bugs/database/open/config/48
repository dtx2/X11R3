### bug number:   1040
### area:         config
### severity:     low
### comments:     various troubles with Ardent


Bob,

   just to let you know that we have built most of X11 R3 beta succesfully
   on the Ardent titan.  We are having runtime problems with:

[what's this? -ralph]
      xedit.new

   It does not display any text?

      x10tox11

   It has problem with unix domain!!

      xman

   We have to convert it to decode the compressed man pages in /usr/man/catman
   apart from these clients we are not having any major problems.  I include
   some nits I came across during the build.  My compliments to your team
   I am eagerly looking forward to the real release (apparently the HP widget
   set will have some major cleanup done).

[fixed]
dix: The following functions are declared both static and extern, causing
our compiler to generate missing external references (the code is not
ANSII compatible):

   XYToWindow
   NormalKeyboardEvent
   DoFocusEvents
   CheckMotion

[fixed]
mfb/maskbits.h: The external declarations for rmask and mask:

   extern int rmask[32];
   extern int mask[32];

Though legal C cause our compiler to barf.  I know we should (and are) 
going to fix our compiler but I wanted to list all the problems we had 
discovered.

[fixed]
xcalc:
   The variable timerdone is not declared volatile and so a good Ansii
   optimizing compiler may optimize 

      while (!timerdone) ;  

   by moving the expression evaluation outside the loop.

x10tox11:
   resource.h redefines BUFSIZ and this include file is included before stdio.h
   causing our compiler to report a redefined constant.

[fixed]
   also in resource.h sprintf is redeclared as

      char *sprintf();

   sprintf should be 

      int sprintf();

   and is declared in <stdio.h>

   in X10/X.h there is an 

      #ifdef titan
      #define BIGSHORTS
      typedef unsigned char * caddr_t;
      #endif

   
   which is incorrect on our machine, who else is using the define titan?


kterm:

   The fixes for the GIN input code have not been applied to TekEnqMouse.
