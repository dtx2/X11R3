Message-Id:  <8803062325.aa04903@SPARK.BRL.ARPA>

### bug number:   43
### area:         
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	InstallManPages macro doesn't work

DESCRIPTION:
	Setting InstallManPages to NO in *.macros still results in
	their being installed (and a mkdir man<section>).  This
	was a good idea, but as near as I can tell there is no
	code to honor this define.

REPEAT-BY:
	Set InstallManPages to NO in util/imake.includes/<machine>.macros.
	make makefiles
	make install

FIX:
	Surround the mkdir <mandirectory> in TOPDIR/Imakefile by
	#if InstallManPages for starters.  Perhaps do the same
	thing to the body of the install rule in doc/Xlib/Xman/Imakefile.
	The other misc man pages will be harder.
