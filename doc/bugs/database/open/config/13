### bug number:   117

### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	Misc uncleanliness

DESCRIPTION:
	As I'm sure you know, different compilers are good at complaining
	about different things.  The Gould 9080 compiler happens to be good
	at unsigned compares to negative numbers (almost always a bug),
	and functions with both return values and simply "return" (perhaps
	by falling off the end).  The latter is usually because error values
	are returned which may very well be ignored anyway, but they are
	worth fixing.

	Below are the complaints the Gould gives about the core software
	(no drivers included).  I hope you find feedback like this useful.
	
REPEAT-BY:
	making the software on a Gould.
