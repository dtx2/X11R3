### bug number:   958
### area:         config
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

It seems more than slightly brain-dead that there are non-archive files
with .a extensions.  The X distribution (or maybe only X11R3) has MANY
such files.  This produces incorrect behavior for transfer programs
which are set up to ignore archive files.

.a is for archive.
