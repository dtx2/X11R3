Protocol Specification (X version 11, release 2)

In the description of CreateGC, the description
of wide lines (pages 45-46) includes the sentence:

    "A pixel is part of the line (and hence drawn) if the
     center of the pixel is fully inside the bounding box ..."

This sentence raises an ambiguity concerning the meaning of
coordinates in X11: other references to pixel coordinates treat
pixels as indivisible objects, so it makes sens to associate
the coordinate (0,0) with the top-left pixel, for example.

Since the notion of "the center of a pixel" appears in the
definition of wide line behaviour, it is now necessary to treat
the pixels as unit squares in real-number coordinate system.
The question not answered by the protocol spec is

        Where in the pixel (x,y) is the point (x,y) ?

I suspect that the answer is that point (x,y) is the upper left
corner of pixel (x,y), but the answer could alternatively be
that point (x,y) is at the centre of the pixel!
