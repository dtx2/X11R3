Subject:        XLookupColor documentation doesn't match code

### bug number:   508
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Bell Technologies 386/AT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3

DISPLAY:
	Video 7 VEGA (IBM EGA clone)

SYNOPSIS:
	XLookupColor documentation doesn't match code

DESCRIPTION:
	The documentation for XLookupColor lists the last two arguments
	in the order "visual_def_return, exact_def_return".  However, the
	code actually returns "exact_def_return, visual_def_return".

REPEAT-BY:
	Eyeball the documentation and the code.  Note that the variable
	names in the code are less than ideal;  you must look at the way
	the reply structure is used.

FIX:
	Reverse the arguments in either the code or the documentation.
	It is probably better to change the code, since this would be
	consistent with XAllocNamedColor, but this might break existing
	programs.
