VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Prime EXL

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	System 5 Release 3

DISPLAY:
	PC Xsight

SYNOPSIS:
	 The bitmap "wierd_size" is misspelled

DESCRIPTION:
	 Is there some reason that the bitmap "wierd_size" is
	 misspelled?  I've noticed that it has kept the same
	 spelling since we first received the beta release of
	 X11.  We are preparing to release a product, and the
	 misspelling of "wierd" offends our documentation staff.

REPEAT-BY:
	ls X11/bitmaps/wierd_size

FIX:
	mv wierd_size weird_size
