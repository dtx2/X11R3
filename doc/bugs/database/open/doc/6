       I recently unpacked the X.V11R2 distribution and found that
       doc/Toolkit/{widgets,usenix}.PS had problems.

   I just extracted these files from core.hc on expo, and they are
   identical to the files in our source pool.  For reference, the sum for
   widgets.PS is 53372, and the sum for usenix.PS is 60188.  Perhaps you
   were just bitten by the SunOS 3.4 tcp bug that everyone is complaining
   about.  I suggest you try sucking core.hc over again.


I brought core.hc over again, but usenix.PS still had problems.  It printed out
more this time, but the last half was mangled.  Everything upto and including
page 5 was fine.  Then there was a blank page, except for the page number,
followed by a completely blank page, and then 6 mangled pages.  The last 6 pages
were all offset up 2/3 of a page and slightly to the right, so that only the
lower third of the text was visible at the top of the page.  The order of the
pages also appeared to be reversed wrt previous pages.
