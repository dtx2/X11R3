### area:         doc

### status:       
### comments:     user misunderstood man page, should have had \fIgeom\fP


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/280

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	bw2

SYNOPSIS:
	 The xterm manual page seems to have an error in the icon geometry
	 description.

DESCRIPTION:
	 The man entry for xterm states that the icon geometry can
	 be specified on the command line by

	 #geom

	 but the program actually seems to expect only #. Looking at
	 xterm/main.c confirms this.

REPEAT-BY:
	Try

	xterm #+110+100 &

	and iconify the window; it ends up at 100, 100. Try

	xterm #geom+110+100 &

	and iconify the window; it ends up at 0, 0. Try

	xterm #geom +110+100 &

	and xterm says

	Unknown option "+100+100".

FIX:
	Decide which way you want it and fix the manual or the program.
