X Protocol
==========

Page 9. Typo or leftover from X10?

    For  "Every core event (with the exception of KeymapNotify"
    Read "Every core event (with the excpetion of MappingNotify"


Page 22. Missing something

    For "specifies whether map and configure requests"
    Read "specifies whether map, circulate and configure requests"


Page 32. Protocol specification is imprecise - Clarification needed!

    The precise point at which timestamps are generated is not
    adequately defined in the protocol specification. The
    discussions of pointer and keyboard freezing says:

        "If the pointer-mode is Synchronous, the state of the pointer
         (as seen by means of the protocol) appears to freeze, and no
         further pointer events are generated by the server until ..."

        "Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is
         frozen. They are simply queued for later processing."

    This does not make it entirely clear when pointer events
    get timestamped. I think the protocol specification should say
    one or other of the following:

    a) "Pointer events are timestamped when the physical pointer
        changes happen, regardless of whether the protocol state of the
        pointer is frozen or not."
    b) "Pointer events queued while the protocol state of the
        pointer is frozen will be timestamped when the server finally
        processes them, not as they are placed into the queue."

    I don't know which of these the sample server actually does;
    I didn't look because the protocol spec is the final authority :-)


PS. If I have missed something in the spec which does clarify
the issue of timestamps then please tell me - I am trying to
write part of a book on this subject!
