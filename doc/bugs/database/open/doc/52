X Protocol Specification
========================

Page 9. The following is slightly misleading:

        "Every reply consists of 32 bytes, followed by zero
         or more additional bytes of data, as specified by the
         length field."

    This would be clearer if it said

        "additional units of 4 bytes, as specified..."

    since this is the unit that such lengths are measured in.


Page 33. Typo in GrabButton:

        For  "terminated automatically when he logical state"
        Read "terminated automatically when the logical state"


Page 72. Confusion in details of LeaveNotify.

        "..., and only clients selection LeaveNotify receive
         LeaveNotify events."

        This should presumably read "selecting" rather than
        "selection", but the EventMask for this is surely
        LeaveWindow?!


Page 120. Mistake in structure layout

        The reply which indicates the last part of the
        reply to ListFontsWithInfo doesn't really have
        fifty-two unused bytes does it??


Suggested additions to the Index

Event mask       - page 22 (in CreateWindow)
Event mask       - page 23 (in ChangeWindowAttributes)

All of the common types should be indexed, e.g. FONTABLE,
presumably all to their definitions in section 4, but also the
Appendix B encoding details where this is not "obvious"; i.e.
FONTABLE doesn't, but BITGRAVITY does.
