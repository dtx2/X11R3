VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	the man page Xserver seems to disagree on precisely what the 
syntax of client and server program names is supposed to be.

DESCRIPTION:

There is a paragraph which claims that if the first argument or first
argument following -- does NOT begin with . or /, then its an option.
But the examples at the end show Xsun, not /usr/new/Xsun. Is there
some other disambiguational rule?
