VERSION:
	X11 release 2
SYNOPSIS:

A slight inconsistency exists between the Xlib document and the behavior of
DIX.  In the Xlib document it states in reference to XDefineCursor:

>  XDefineCursor(display, w, cursor)
>        Display *display;
>        Window w;
>        Cursor cursor;
>  
>  
>  display   Specifies the connection to the X server.
>  
>  w         Specifies the window ID.
>  
>  cursor    Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed when
>            the pointer is in the specified window.  You can <****
>            pass None if no cursor is to be displayed.       <****

Which leads one to believe that this is the mechanism used to turn a
window's cursor off.

In the protocol document, under ChangeWindowAttributes it says:

        Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores the default
	cursor.

And nothing more.  

In the sample DIX layer, when an XDefineCursor call is made with the 
cursor set to None, DIX climbs the window hierarchy until it finds 
a window with a non-null cursor, and uses that for the request.

Which is correct?  DIX or the Xlib document?

DESCRIPTION:

Not necessary.

REPEAT-BY:

Did an XDefineCursor with the cursor parameter set to None and got the
root window's cursor.

FIX:
