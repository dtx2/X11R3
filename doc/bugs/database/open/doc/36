### bug number:   571
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	any

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	any

DISPLAY:
	any

AREA:
	doc

SYNOPSIS:
	missing *

DESCRIPTION:
	In Section 2.5 of "X Toolkit Widgets - C Language X Interface", it
	says

	"typedef struct {
	  XtCallbackProc callback;
	  caddr_t client_data;
	} XtCallbackRec, XtCallbackList;"

	I believe there should be a * before XtCallbackList in the last line.

REPEAT-BY:
	Reading the paragraph again.

FILES:
	none

FIX:
	Put in the asterisk.
