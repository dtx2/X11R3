### severity:     low
### comments:     




VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	 SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	19" Monochrome

DESCRIPTION:
	The X Toolkit Intrinsics manual refers to a "XtEventMask" type
	throughout Chapter 10 Event handling. For example, the procedure
	XtAddEventHandler shows the type of the event_mask paramneter
	to be of type XtEventType. However, no such type exists. Referring
	to the source and header files for the X Toolkit, shows that the
	type for event_mask is actually EventMask.

FIX:
	Change either the documentation or add an XtEvent typedef.
