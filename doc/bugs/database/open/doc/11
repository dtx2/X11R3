### assigned to:  
### status:       
### comments:     it should mention the screen on which the property is listed
###               since that is part of the resource manager "protocol", but it
###               explain why there is only one.

    The man page for xrdb(1) indicates that it works on screen 0.  What
    happens with multiple screens?  I know uwm only works on one at a
    time; should users try to figure out, in their .login scripts, how
    many screens their machine has, and handle each separately?

The fact that xrdb only 'works' on screen 0 is intentional:
>From the user's point of view there should only be one server
resource database.   The definition of the server resource database
is a pre-defined property of a pre-defined window of a pre-defined
screen on the display.  The fact that the xrdb man page exposes
this implementation detail (in it's first sentence, no less) is
a bug.

That uwm is not able to manage multiple screens is considered an
implementation bug.
