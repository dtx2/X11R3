### bug number:   42
### area:         documentation
### severity:     
### assigned to:  Jim
### status:       rejected, user misunderstood what documentation meant

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Sun

SYNOPSIS:
	Missing Hardcopy files?

DESCRIPTION:
	The release notes say that the hardcopy distribution contains
	PostScript, dvi, runoff, and plain text.  This would be nice
	but in fact only PostScript is included.

REPEAT-BY:
	Look at core.hc

FIX:
	Include the other forms of hardcopy (or else change the
	release notes).

[Three more "bugs" follow all related to Makefile issues.  I am
honoring your one-per-message request.  In all, this was a very
clean easy to install release.  Thanks a bunch.]
