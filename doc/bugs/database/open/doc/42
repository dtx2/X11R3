(All re X11R2)

X Protocol
==========
1) There is a mistake in the description of the ConfigureRequest event:

  For:  "sibling and stack mode, which are reported as Above and None"
  Read: "sibling and stack mode, which are reported as None and Above"

The types don't match otherwise.

2) Couple of typos; in the descriptions of both FocusIn and
   EnterNotify the phrase

        "... grab actives have mode ..." should read
        "... grab activates have mode ..."

3) Some additional index entries would be useful. In particular

   Sequence number      referring to Section 2, Event Format
   Visual Type          referring to Section 9, Connection Setup


XLib
====
1) The description of the macro AllPlanes says

        AllPlanes()

   when in fact is it a macro without arguments and so should
   be used as

        AllPlanes               /* no parentheses */
