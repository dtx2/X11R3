### bug number:   207

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	 Documentation for X(1) and xrdb(1) and .Xdefaults format.
	 (From a general users point of view)

DESCRIPTION:
	 The documentation for X(1) under X10 gave an example .Xdefaults
	 file, but X(1) under X11 does not.  X(1) under X11 tells of
	 the valid format for this file, but I think that there should
	 be some reference to the difference between X10 format and
	 X11's format.

	 I don't think that a general user is willing (even if they can
	 get their hands on the Xlib -- C Language Interface doc)
	 to lookup the Xlib C-library "Resource Manager Matching Rules"
	 (by the way this is in section 10.11.1) to find out how they
	 need to define their .Xdefaults.

	 Also, the start of a comment under X10 was a "#" and under X11
	 it is a "!".

	 
FIX:

	I don't know the best way of solving this problem, but maybe
	you can create a man page on it and reference it from X(1) and
	xrdb(1).

	also, xrdb(1) should talk about the format of the file
	(how "." and "*" and "!" ":" work).  And make some reference to
	how X10 use to do things (i.e. "." and "#" ":")
