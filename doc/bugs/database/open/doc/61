Yup, the code for XQueryTextExtents returns the value and the routine isn't
declared void....

I'd report this officially, but I can't find the form...
Anyway, it's minor.  Feel free to ignore it if you have more important
things on your mind.

XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 return int in their code, 
but aren't declared as such in their source files (release 3, 
pre-release), or documented as such (DECPress draft - I haven't 
looked at the R3 version yet).

This is only a bug in ANSI C, it won't cause any programs to fail.

Also, it strikes me as extremely strange that XGetWindowProperty
uses the opposite return values as almost everything else.
Standard is 1 for success, 0 for failure.
XGetWindowProperty is the only Xlib routine to return the constant
Success (0), and it returns 1 to mean failure.  Am I missing something?
