Subject: Xlib document makefile enhancement

### bug number:   244
### area:         doc
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     



I was talkig to Jim Gettys yesterday, and he asked that I send this
along.  This isn't precisely a bug report, but more of an operational
documentation enhancement. 

In the makefile for the Xlib documentation (XV11R2/doc/Xlib/makefile),
I thought it awkward to have to make the main document, then find out
what page it ended on and edit the `indexmacros.t' file to make it
start on the next page number. I worked out a way to do it
automatically, so you can get the document and its index together
(still as two files, though). 

Unforthunately, my disk containing the X11 source crashed, so I can't
send actual copies of the modified files, but I use these same
techniques in another place, so I outline the procedure:

Basically, the `append.t' file has a `.tm \n%' inserted just before the
last `.PX' command, to write the page number to the `index.raw' file, e.g:

	.EH ''''
	.OH ''''
	.EF ''''
	.OF ''''
	\&
	.LP
	.XS
	Index
	.XE
	.tm .pn \n%
	.PX

The relevant parts of the modified makefile are:

	doc: $(FILES)
		eqn $(FILES) | tbl | $(TROFF) -ms 2> index.raw > rtdoc.PS
		make index	

	index:	index.raw
		tail -1 <index.raw >index.pageno
		grep -v '^.pn' index.raw | sort -f -t: +1 -3 +0n -1n | \
		    awk -f fixindex.awk | awk -f block.awk >index.troff
		${TROFF} -me indexmacros.t index.troff > rtdoc.index.PS
		rm -f index.troff index.pageno


Thus, the makefile entry for `index' is modified to pick this appended
line from the `index.raw' file and copy it to `index.pageno', where it
will later be included by an `.so' in the `indexmacros.t' file. 

The line in the `indexmacros.t' file is modified from:
   .pn XXX      [where XXX is some explicit page number]
to:
   .so index.pageno

You still have to print two files, but they are created with no further 
intervention.
