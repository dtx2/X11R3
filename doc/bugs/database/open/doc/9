    Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the text, but I think that a part of section 5 in
    the Xlib document references an incorrect structure field.  In the "Graphics
    Resource Functions" section, the following text appears:

	  "The dash_list value allowed here is actually a simplified
	   form of the more general patterns that can be set with
	   XSetDashes.  Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to
	   specifying the two element list [N, N] in XSetDashes.  The
	   value must be nonzero. Otherwise, a BadValue error is
	   generated.  The meaning of dash_offset and dash_list are
	   explained for the XSetDashes function."

    In the first sentence, shouldn't 'dash_list' actually be 'dashes' (the last
    field in the XGCValues structure)?  From the gist of the paragraph, I assume
    that they are saying that XGCValues.dashes is a simplified form of the
    dash_list which is specified as a parameter in XSetDashes().

You are correct.  The offending reference is on page 66, Section 5.3.
