### bug number:   987
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 3 (pre-release)
SYNOPSIS:
	Some Xaw widgets honor "reverseVideo" but Xaw documentation doesn't
	reflect that option.
DESCRIPTION:
	Configuration:
		server:	Sun 3/50, SunOS3.2
		client: Symmetry S81, Dynix 3.0.12

	These are the widgets which DO honor the option:
	    Clock.c
	    Load.c
	    Logo.c
	    Mailbox.c
	    Scroll.c

REPEAT-BY:
	Look through the code; fire up "examples/Xaw/xwidgets -reverse" and
	observe the results.
FIX:

	Document the option in the Xaw document (and upcoming man pages???)
