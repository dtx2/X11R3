VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/260

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	MotionNotifyHints don't work.  Not even once.  Doing a querypointer
	does not help.

DESCRIPTION:
	Not needed.

REPEAT-BY:

/* Motion hint notify regression test */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>

main() {
    Display *dpy;
    Window win;
    XEvent e;
    Window root, child;
    int x, y, root_x, root_y;
    unsigned int mask;

    dpy = XOpenDisplay (NULL);
    win = XCreateSimpleWindow (dpy, DefaultRootWindow (dpy),
			       100, 100, 500, 500,
			       1, /* Border width */
			       WhitePixel (dpy, DefaultScreen (dpy)),
			       BlackPixel (dpy, DefaultScreen (dpy)));
    XMapWindow (dpy, win);
    XSelectInput (dpy, win, PointerMotionHintMask);
    XQueryPointer (dpy, win, &root, &child,
		   &root_x, &root_y, &x, &y, &mask);
    printf ("Query pointer --> %d, %d\n", x, y);
    XNextEvent (dpy, &e);
    printf ("Event type: %d, xy = (%d, %d)\n",
	    e.type, e.xmotion.x, e.xmotion.y);
}


FIX:
	None, but a workaround is to use PointerMotionMask, and do
	   while (XCheckMaskEvent (dpy, PointerMotionMask, &e));
	Thus elliminating extraneous mouse events.  This works OK so
	long as you only look for pointer movement if you really want it,
	to avoid queuing up large numbers of events.

Even if it worked correctly in the sample server, The round trip
needed to reset the motion hint flag in the server with QueryPointer
is unnecessary and wasteful.  A client that wants fast interactive
response would be better served if there were a 1-way call to reset
that flag.  The x&y values stored in the event structure are adequate.
If its not too late, a protocol extension to reset the motion hint
flag with a 1-way message would be greatly appreciated.
