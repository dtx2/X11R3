### bug number:   325
### area:         doc
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     

The last line of the file is supposed to be a comment with the list of
all the used fonts. Unfortunately somebody seems to have "fixed" it by
breaking this "long" line into two pieces. The right thing to do is to
change the LF after "Times-BolItalic" in the next to last line to a space.

The file is not currently legal PostScript(R).
