### severity:     low
### comments:     

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/160

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	Sun B&W

SYNOPSIS:
	AllPlanes is either misimplemented or misdocumented

DESCRIPTION:
	Page 6 of the "Xlib - C Language X Interface" writeup shows
		AllPlanes()
	as the invocation, but <X11/Xlib.h> has
		#define AllPlanes		(~0)
	as the definition, meaning that parentheses should not appear
	in the invocation.

FIX:
	Take your pick of changing the header or changing the writeup.
