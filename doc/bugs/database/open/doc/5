You say:
	util/makedepend/
		...If the configuration parameter CppSourcesPresent is
		defined... a copy of the C preprocessor built into
		it for speed.  This is not necessary...

This is wrong.  Cpp is built in for correctness.  Without it,
makedepend will evaluate all #if expressions as true, instead of
figuring out if they might be false.  In most cases this has no
effect on the output of makedepend.  And it turns out that makedepend
is slower with cpp compiled in.  Unless, of course, you have changed
makedepend...

No reply required; just change the notes for next time.

Todd

PS
Thanks for all the great plugs for the PC.
