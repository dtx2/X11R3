### bug number:   676
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	Xt documentation refers to a 'client_data' member which is in fact
	called 'closure'

DESCRIPTION:
	page 33 of the Xt Intrinsics document says that the XtCallbackrec
	struct is of the form 
		typedef struct _XtCallbackRec {
		    XtCallbackProc  callback;
		    caddr_t	    client_data;
		} XtCallbackRec;
	whereas it is in fact of the form 
		typedef struct _XtCallbackRec {
		    XtCallbackProc  callback;
		    caddr_t	    closure;
		} XtCallbackRec;
	

REPEAT-BY:
	Reading Xt Intrinsics and comparing with <Intrinsics.h>
