Subject: protocol spec unclear

### bug number:   460
### area:         doc
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	doesn't matter

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	doesn't matter

DISPLAY:
	doesn't matter

SYNOPSIS:
	Description of copy-area needs clarification.

DESCRIPTION:
	The description of copy-area on pages 52-53 in the X Window
	System Protocol document doesn't indicate what happens if the
	window being cleared has children.  Specifically, mention is
	made of the plane mask and function, but the assumed setting of
	the subwindow-mode is not.
		
REPEAT-BY:
	doesn't matter.

FIX:
	The fourth sentence for ClearArea near the bottom of page 52:
	  If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle is
	  tiled with a plane-mask of all ones and a function of Copy.
	should be changed to be something like:
	  If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle is
	  tiled with a plane-mask of all ones, a function of Copy and a
	  subwindow-mode of ClipByChildren.
	Another wording is:
	  If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle is
	  tiled using the default values for the following gcontext
	  components: function, plane-mask and subwindow-mode.
