	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	xterm man page is wrong/misleading

DESCRIPTION:
	several places in the xterm man page, it mentions the default
	setting of a resource is "false", but if you look at the
	sources, it's clear that the resource strings are parsed on
	the basis of "on" or "off", not "true" and "false"

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
	use your favorite text editor
