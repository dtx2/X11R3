Subject: Xlib man page installation

### bug number:   350
### area:         doc
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:	
	SUN-3/60

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SUN OS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4

SYNOPSIS:
	on "make install", Xlib man pages are installed with
	suffix "3X"

DESCRIPTION:
	If you use the standard imake settings that come with the
	distribution, man pages are all copied into a single directory
	with the "ManSuffix" applied (which is "n" for "new" section)
	Except for the Xlib man pages which end up with "3X" suffixes.
	That confuses the SUN OS 3.5 "man" program which cannot find
	those man pages, because it expects the "n" suffix for pages
	in the "new" section.

REPEAT-BY:
	you really don't want to do this
	(I assume the standard imake settings)

	make World
	make install

FIX:
	I suppose the Xlib man pages should really go in section 3,
	anyway. But given the current setup, maybe the simplest thing
	is just to have the "ManSuffix" applied to them.
