VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	n/a

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	n/a

DISPLAY:
	n/a

SYNOPSIS:
	X(1), Xlib, xclock documentation nits

DESCRIPTION:
    1)	In the man page for X(1), under the discussion of XENVIRONMENT,
	shouldn't the name for .Xdefaults-hostname be specified as
	~/.Xdefaults-hostname or $HOME/.Xdefaults-hostname to make
	it clear that this file should be in one's home directory?

    2)  In the man page for X(1), "chartrusse" should be spelled "chartreuse"

    3)  The resources listed in the xclock man page do not seem to be
	consistent with the source code.  I find that the resource specified
	as "hand" in the xclock man page needs to be called "hands" in my
	.Xdefaults file in order for it to work, and similarly "high" must
	actually be specified as "highlight".  The resources "geometry",
	"x", and "y" are also missing from the documenet yet seem to work.
	Shouldn't the xclock man page define all of the resources that
	can be specified that are not covered by X(1)?

    4)  Xlib Sec 10.11.2.2 - Looking up from a Resource Database
	Argument is called str_value_return in the arglist, but value_return
	in the declaration and description.

    5)  Xlib Sec 10.11.3 - Parsing command line options
	2nd-to-last paragraph of p. 222.  Two occurrences of "(arc, argv)"
	should be changed to "(argc, argv)".

    6)  Xlib Sec 10.11 - Name and class are not defined for use in this
	context.  Class is defined in the glossary, but as it applies
	to window class (InputOutput or InputOnly).  In general, this
	section is where all the terminology clashes between the X server
	and the X toolkit are exposed (resource, class, etc. mean something
	different in this section than they do anywhere else).

    7)  In the man page for X(1), under the description for Geometry
	specification, for the description of 48x48--5--10, change "off
	the right edge and the screen" to "off the right edge of the screen".

    8)  Xlib Sec 10.2 - refers to XGetDefaults in 2nd paragraph of p. 199,
	should be XGetDefault, yes?

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
