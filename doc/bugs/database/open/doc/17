VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	QDSS

SYNOPSIS:
	0, :0, 1, :1    which are right?

DESCRIPTION:

I finally got an Xqdss to run on sage:1.  The trick was to use ":1" as
the "displaynumber" argument when running the server.

I checked the XSERVER man page and there is no mention of putting a
colon before the displaynumber in the text or the synopsis, but the
example on the second page shows window="/etc/X :0 -c -l".

/usr/bin/X11/Xqdss 0      works
/usr/bin/X11/Xqdss :0     (might work, I haven't tried it)
/usr/bin/X11/Xqdss 1      does not work
/usr/bin/X11/Xqdss :1     does work

That colon is a nice little undocumented feature.  Eh?

REPEAT-BY:

FIX:
	see above for workaround
