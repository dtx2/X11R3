### bug number:   728
### area:         doc
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	(e.g. Sun 3/280, Microvax II, HP 9000, IBM PC/RT, etc.)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	(e.g. Ultrix 2.0, SunOS 3.4, 4.3bsd, etc.)

DISPLAY:
	(e.g. QVSS, GPX, CG4, HP TOPCAT, etc.)

SYNOPSIS:
	weak description of Xlibs Errorhandling.

DESCRIPTION:
	There seems to be a rule that if there are
	problems with system calls, these problems
	are treated fatal ( as mentioned in Xlib 
	C Library Release 2, chapter 8.12.2 ).
	 But the more general chapter 1 for instance
	does not make clear above idea, instead 
	saying "if function fails, it will return zero".

REPEAT-BY:
	e.g.
	while( XOpenDisplay( "" ) != NULL );
	printf( "running out of connections\n" );

FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
