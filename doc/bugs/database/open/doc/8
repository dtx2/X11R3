   Xlib should point out in sec.  8.4.6.7 that XRefreshKeyboard mapping
does not strictly have to be called on a MappingPointer, and does nothing
if it is, since nothing needs to be done.  Also, this section has a bad
sentence:

If
.PN MappingModifier ,
the specified keycodes are used as modifiers.

Should be 

If
.PN MappingModifier ,
the modifier mapping is changed.
