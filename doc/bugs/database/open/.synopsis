Xt/16	258	Attaching a translation to a realized widget, where the
		action is a global action, messes up all translations for
		that widget.

Xt/18	264	Because of the postponement of widget destruction until
		XtNextEvent is called, there's no documented way to force
		widget destruction, and subsequent state cleanup, without
		getting another event.

Xt/19	282	Re: icons, conventions.

Xt/21	304	ShellWidget and non-unity resize increments

Xt/23	345	Text widget does many, many extraneous XClear's, doesn't

		doesn't handle wordBreak on the final line correctly.

Xt/24	346	When VPaned receives a geometry request from a child whose
		allowResize resource is True, it responds to the requesting
		widget correctly, but leaves the other panes in the widget
		unaltered.

Xt/27	358	XtDialogCreate doesn't exist

Xt/28	363	Adding a global translation to a realized widget destroys
		the widget's translations.

Xt/3	95	Why is there an XtRInt but no Int type?

Xt/30	396	Shells without a managed child cannot be realized

Xt/32	400	_XtTranslateEvent() drops enter and leave events which have
		a detail of NotifyInferior

Xt/33	402	XtGetValues() returns bogus information on 68000
		architecture machines, if the application queries a short
		or char value, and it also specifies within the arglist  a
		pointer to a short or char variable, into which the result
		is to be placed.

Xt/34	406	The toolkit intrinsics document says the 'source' argument
		to an InputCallbackProc (as called when a source specified
		by XtAddInput is ready) is passed by value, when it is
		actually passed by reference.

Xt/37	414	FocusOut events are not dispatched to insensitive widgets.

Xt/38	416	This is a documentation error in the Toolkit.

Xt/39	420	CoreDestroy() frees up resources owned by the application

Xt/4	96	x toolkit documentation is VERY weak.

Xt/41	436	XtAugmentTranslations can dump core.

Xt/42	437	There is no way to get the second phase of
		XtDestroyWidget() to happen on demand without possibly
		blocking in XtNextEvent().

Xt/44	462	Text widget does not understand all of the events it should
		using the default translation table.

Xt/45	465	A more flexible mechanism is needed by clients to provide
		hints to the window manager for specifiying information
		about icons.  Specifically, icon pixmap, icon title, icon
		geometry. These facilities exist, though they are not
		readily accessable via the resource manager or from the
		clients command line. Window managers may use these hints
		or completely ignore them providing their own icons.

Xt/47	469	Inconsistent use of cursor

Xt/48	491	Several clients and contribs that use the Toolkit give a
		bad class and/or a bad instance name.

Xt/5	121	Re: How do I set an icon's pixmap?

Xt/50	518	Under certain conditions, it is possible for a widget to
		have more than one keyboard focus entry on the grablist,
		when in fact only one should have been present.

Xt/51	519	The Xtk keyboard focus mechanism overrides X key grabs.

Xt/52	520	Popping up a spring loaded widget causes the current
		keyboard focus widget to not get a LeaveNotify event.

Xt/53	521	LeaveNotify events occasionally are not generated.

Xt/54	531	XtTranslateCoords() is useless if used in conjunction with
		a reparenting window manager

Xt/55	541	Because of the resource caching done in the resource
		manager, there are times when a resource will be freed
		twice.

Xt/56	542	Destroying a widget with shell children STILL dumps core
		under certain circumstances.

Xt/57	549	Xtk will not allow a widget (during its phase 2 destroy) to
		destroy another, unrelated, widget.

Xt/58	554	Because of the way the loop was written, only a single
		input-source event will be handled per XtNextEvent. In
		addition, the input-source event handler cannot call
		XtNextEvent without being called again.

Xt/59	572	Similar problems in XtPending as were in XtNextEvent.

doc/25	430	A slight inconsistency exists between the Xlib document and
		the behavior of DIX.  In the Xlib document it states in
		reference to XDefineCursor:  >  XDefineCursor(display, w,
		cursor) >        Display *display; >        Window w;
		>        Cursor cursor; > > >  display   Specifies the
		connection to the X server.  > >  w         Specifies the
		window ID.  > >  cursor    Specifies the cursor that is to
		be displayed when >            the pointer is in the
		specified window.  You can <**** >            pass None if
		no cursor is to be displayed.       <**** Which leads one
		to believe that this is the mechanism used to turn a
		window's cursor off.  In the protocol document, under
		ChangeWindowAttributes it says:  Changing the cursor of a
		root window to None restores the default cursor.  And
		nothing more.  In the sample DIX layer, when an
		XDefineCursor call is made with the cursor set to None, DIX
		climbs the window hierarchy until it finds a window with a
		non-null cursor, and uses that for the request.  Which is
		correct?  DIX or the Xlib document?  Keith Marchington HP
