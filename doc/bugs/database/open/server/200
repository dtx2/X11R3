   PROBLEMS WITH X11R2


   GENERAL

    * X11 apprears to be about an order of magnitude slower than X10.


   SERVER (Xqdss)

    * When the server is started by init (in the ttys file), there is
      a significant (maybe 20%) probability that on logout the window
      will go blank and the machine will hang, requiring a hard system
      reset.

    * Under certain circumstances the same thing happens on startup.
      I noticed it when our server was down (although none of the X11
      stuff needs to reference the server).  Possibly it is sensitive
      to perturbations in network traffic.


   WINDOW MANAGER (uwm)

    * The "autoselect" option does not work.

	[fixed]

    * When uwm exits or restarts, all icon windows get deiconified --
      with positions about 1/4 inch away from where they are supposed to
      be.

	[The deiconifying is correct]
	[Dragging out now includes borders]

    * An icon position of "#-0-0" translates to off screen.  A window
      position of "-g -0-0" is (correctly) on screen.

	[the #geom isn't really a geometry spec, it is shorthand for #xy;
	 the current window manager conventions don't allow one to specify
	 real geometry; the answer is "can't do it, that's for window managers"]

    * The shadow lines shown during resize or move operations are 
      positioned about 1/4 inch off from the edges of the window.

	[fixed]

    * The resize function will not extend a window down to the bottom
      of the screen.

	[fixed]

    * There seems to be no control of icon colors or border widths.
      In general, the X10 handling is nicer.

	[fixed]

    * How about some control of the color of the shadow lines?  The
      current algorithm seems to pick random colors, some of which
      are not appropriate.

	[this is a boolean operation, not one for which you select a color]

      NOTE: The positioning problems may be related to the 4 pixel
      window borders I use.


   STANDARD CLIENTS & INTRINSICS

    * In xterm, if -n and -e are both specified, the icon name is from
      the -e instead of the -n.  In this situation, sometimes the
      icon name may be "forgotten" after some use.

    * Xterm does not offer a title bar.

	[it isn't supposed to, that is for window managers]

    * In xclock, the resource name for the hands color is "hands", not
      "hand" (documentation error).

	[fixed]

    * Xload lacks a highlight color (the X10 version had a highlight
      color for the host name and lines).

    * The mouse pointer disappears in buttons on most clients that
      have them.  That can be a serious problem.  Probably a fault
      in the button widget.

    * Xman causes the screen (including the mouse pointer) to freeze
      when you hit the "manual" button.

    * Bitmap is *extremely* slow.

	[use bitmap*Dashed: off]

    * Most clients ignore ^C interrupts.  The X10 versions were sensitive
      to ^C.

	[fixed]

    * I can't figure out how to use the "app-defaults" directory.
      How about some more documentation?


   OTHER CLIENTS

    * In general, the contributed programs make poor use of the Xt
      intrinsics and standard widgets.

    * GNU Emacs offers much poorer control over mouse color, cursor
      color, and window geometry than the X10 version.  Several
      x-set functions do not work.  Resource names are not documented.
      Use of resources from the .Xdefaults file seems haphazzard.

    * In "puzzle", the cursor disappears when it is in that window.
      Also, if the window is inconified it freezes (apparently
      infinite looping).  The mandrill image (and the way the puzzle
      will manipulate chunks of it) is very impressive, by the way.

    * Ico is an interesting demonstration, but the display is too jumpy
      to be pleasing to the eye.

    * The InterViews installation scripts are *very* poorly set up.
      After some hours of hacking, we have still not completed more
      than a small fraction of the installation.  Idraw is particularly
      troublesome.
