### bug number:   401
### area:         server
### severity:     medium
### comments:     swick: my first thought was that the qv driver event queue is
			being overrun, and a buttonRelease is being dropped, but
			in qvvint om_switch is not updated until after the event
			has been successfully put on the queue, so I can't see
			any way to drop device events here.

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	VaxStation 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix 2.0

DISPLAY:
	QVSS

SYNOPSIS:
	unexpected MotionNotify events

DESCRIPTION:
	A client which sets ButtonMotionMask but not PointerMotionMask
	can sometimes receive MotionNotify events while no button is
	down.

REPEAT-BY:
	This is hard to reproduce.  It happened to me today after I was
	clicking all buttons rapidly and concurrently until the server
	got confused.  From them on it was persistent: when the test
	application was run again it kept complaining about spurious
	MotionNotify events.

FIX:
	Sorry.
