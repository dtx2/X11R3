VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 2

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	don't care

DISPLAY:
	Digital QDSS

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	huge tiles and stipples have problems

DESCRIPTION:
	qdPolyFillRectOddSize and friends were assuming that the tile
	or stipple could always be loaded into off-screen memory (and
	caused a FatalError otherwise).  Not true for pixmaps
	larger than total off-screen memory.  One possible solution
	is to generate BadAlloc at some point, e.g. when creating a
	pixmap of that size (ugh), or when attempting to store it as
	the tile or stipple (better).  I've hacked the code to handle
	one case for tiling, so that xman (which uses a huge pixmap
	as its background) works, and caused the other cases to be
	no-ops rather than fatal errors.  Best would be to finish out
	this code to handle everything (even if slowly).

REPEAT-BY:
	eyeball the code
