Subject: X11R2: Xqdss server bug

### bug number:   918
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


X Version: X11R2

Hardware: uVax w/8-plane QDSS.

Problem:
   Console messages printed while in the middle of a drawing operation
cause the origin of the drawing operation to move.

To reproduce:
   Do a drawing operation that will take a reasonable amount of time,
like an XDrawPoints with 10,000 points.  Cause a mesage to be printed
on the console while the points are being draw.  The origin of the
drawing operation will apparently change to (0,0) (relative to the
root) in midstride, thus overwriting random things on the screen, and
the next few operations performed will occur starting at (0,0) instead
of the upper-left hand corner of the appropriate window.
