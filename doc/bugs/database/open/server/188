Subject: QDSS zero width lines on screen don't match zero width offscreen
Date: Thu, 14 Jul 88 10:58:39 EDT

### bug number:   708
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X Window System, Version 11, Release 3

DISPLAY:
	Digital QDSS

AREA:
	server

SYNOPSIS:
	QDSS zero width lines on screen don't match zero width offscreen

DESCRIPTION:
	On screen zero width lines are drawn by the Dragon hardware,
	using a bresenham line drawer, off screen by the mi code which
	conforms to protocol 1 width lines.

REPEAT BY:
	Implement backing store for the QDSS and watch the screen turds fly!

FIX:
	Use one-width line code for on-screen lines, or fix the off-screen
	zero width lines to match.
