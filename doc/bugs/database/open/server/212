### bug number:   882
### area:         server
### severity:     low

The attached bug report describes a problem I had, and a fix which
I am not sure is correct (it works in our environment, but I'm not
sure of the global implications).

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60 

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	BW1

SYNOPSIS:
	When using UNIX-domain client <--> server communication, X creates
	a socket named /tmp/.X11-unix/Xd (where d is the display number,
	usually 0).  On a network with diskless nodes it is useful to share
	/tmp among a number of machines.  This means that multiple machines
	sharing /tmp and using X will overwrite each other's sockets.

DESCRIPTION:
	SYNOPSIS says it all.

REPEAT-BY:
	Have 2 machines sharing /tmp.  Start X on the first, then on the
	second, using a DISPLAY value of "unix:0.0" on both.  On the
	first machine, try to start an X client (e.g. xclock).  The
	application will not start; it will report "unable to open display."

FIX:
	As a temporary fix, I inserted the hostname into the generated
	socket name.  The change must be made in files
	'server/os/4.2bsd/connection.c' and 'lib/X/XConnDis.c'.
