Subject: Problem with X11R2 on Suns

### bug number:   715
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


I've hesitated to send in this bug report since I was hoping to
qualify the problem more.  No other evidence has come up so I'm hoping
this description will strike a chord.

On Sun OS 3.5 running on color and mono 3/50s, X11R2 with all
published fixes, no semi-published speedups, there are occasionally
screen-blank-and-freeze problems. The symptoms are that, while using
the mouse, the screen goes blank and all input seems to be ignored.
One solution (short of rebooting) is to telnet in from another node,
kill the X processes, and then restart X (possibly with some other
twiddling in between).  This seems to occur more often when either the
mouse hasn't been moved for a while and this is moved swiftly, or when
the mouse is moved to the edge of the screen.

Sorry for the nebulous description...
