### bug number:   238

### status:       open
### comments:     looks like a broken C compiler fix to me

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Symbolics 3600

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Symbolics Genera 7.2

DISPLAY:
	NA

SYNOPSIS:
	Passing pointers (fPointer = 1) doesn't work.

DESCRIPTION:
	The current implementation of passing pointers rather than XID's
to DoChangeGC is flawed.  It assumes that a pointer is the same size as
a long and can be freely cast back and forth without losing information.
This is not true in general in C.  This problem also affects all callers
who try to pass in pointers by building an array of longs and trying to
stuff pointers into them.

REPEAT-BY:
	Bring up a color server.

FIX:
	I changed DoChangeGC to maintain two pointers, one of type (XID
*) and the other of type (pointer *).  It casts pval to which ever one
is appropriate for the value it is trying to pick up.

I also fixed the caller (miOpqStipDrawable).
