VERSION:
	X11 release 2, fixes 1-11 installed

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/140

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.4.2

DISPLAY:
	/dev/bwtwo0 (monochrome, single bitplane)

SYNOPSIS:
	If a GrabKey has been activated as a result of pressing
	(and holding down) modifier key(s) in some window, then a
	ButtonPress event following the KeyPress event(s) will not
	have the modifier key(s) properly indicated in the
	xbutton.state field.  This is true for at least the case of
	GrabKey and GrabButton passive grabs set for the parent of a
	window.

DESCRIPTION:

	This is how we set the Passive Grabs for the parent of an
	X-application window.  The parent also has gadget (Input-Only)
	subwindows.

    XGrabButton(dpy, (unsigned int) AnyButton, AnyModifier,
		w,
		False,
		(unsigned int) (ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask),
		GrabModeSync, GrabModeSync,
		None,
		None);

    XGrabKey(dpy, (int) AnyKey, (unsigned) AnyModifier,
	     w,
	     False,
	     GrabModeSync, GrabModeSync);


FIX:
	?
