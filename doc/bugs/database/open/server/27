The included source program (a converted version of the Apollo screen
melt program posted to comp.sys.apollo) demonstrates what appears to
be a bug in the implementation of the sample server; the problem
appears to be that the blit is always clipped by the source region.

The V11R1 Xlib document, on page 68, 3rd full paragraph, states that

   For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination window is
   clipped by inferiors.  This will result in drawing through subwindow
   boundaries.

This has been tried on microvax and RT servers.

(yes, I know this program is unfriendly; that's the whole point of
it...)

If this has been fixed already, sorry for the duplication.

Feel free to add this program to the distribution if the copyright
allows it... it would be a neat little hack if it worked OK.
(according to someone I was talking to at the Apollo recruiting open
house, they unleash this program without warning on all new hires at
Apollo; some people confuse it with broken hardware..).
