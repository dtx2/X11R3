### bug number:   221
### area:         server
### severity:     fairly high
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     completely hoses HP server

VERSION:
	X11 release 1 (Still waiting for the RT update for R2) and R2 on others

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT, HP

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd, HPUX

DISPLAY:
	apa16, topcat

SYNOPSIS:
	Screen locks up if someone connects to port 6000.

DESCRIPTION:
	If a person with or without xhost privilages on another machine
	telnet's or otherwise connects to port 6000 on the server machine,
	the server will cease all activity until the other connection is
	closed or the server recieves enough garbage to close the connection
	itself. I am not sure this is considered a bug but I did not want to
	put this to the xpert list since this describes how to do something
	destructive.

REPEAT-BY:
	telnet server.host.domain 6000
