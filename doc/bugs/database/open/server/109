VERSION:
    X11 Release 1, Release 2 with updates 1-11 on ACIS 4.3
SYNOPSIS:
    IBM Megapel bitmaps are broken
DESCRIPTION:
    A bitmap larger than 32 bits wide is replicated rather than
    continued.  Ex 0-31, 0-15 for a 48 bit wide bitmap. There does
    not seem to be    a problem    in the Y direction.
REPEAT-BY:
    xbiff - note that the mailbox    is chopped and    duplicated.
    xshell - same thing    only    worse. Replicated 3    times.
FIX:
    Nope.
