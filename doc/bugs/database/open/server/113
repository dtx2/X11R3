VERSION:
	X11 release 2
 
CLIENT MACHINE:
	microVAX 3500 GPX
 
CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Ultrix V2.2
 
DISPLAY:
	qdss (color) the server is Xqdss
 
SYNOPSIS:
	The Xqdss server grows in size as X is being used.  It does not
	seem to ever get smaller.
 
DESCRIPTION:
	When I first boot my machine the Xqdss server is about 500kb in
	size (virtual).  As I use my workstation it grows in size until
	random other programs running on my machine fail due to a lack of
	swap space.  By this time the server has grown to over 5 mb in
	virtual size.  This normally takes three to five days.  Killing the
	server causes init to fork a new 500 kb copy.  This copy again grows
	without bound until I must kill it.

	I have applied fixes 1-111 to my sources and am running the patched
	version of X.
