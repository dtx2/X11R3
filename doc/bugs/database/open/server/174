### bug number:   647
### area:         server
### severity:     very low
### comments:     


VERSION:
        X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
        MicroVax II (KA630 processor), MicorVax III (KA650 processor)

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
        MIT-LCS's 4.3 BSD

DISPLAY:
	QDSS

SYNOPSIS:
	X11/Xqdss is too slow.

DESCRIPTION:
	X11/Xqdss is so noticebly slower (main-CPU intensive) than
X10/Xqdss that I doubt anyone with an QDSS (who runs more than just
xterm/xclock/xload/gnuemacs) will ever want to switch to X11.

REPEAT-BY:
	Feel free to arange with me a time for some demos.

FIX:
