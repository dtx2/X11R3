R3 bugs and fixes for the HP server

- - CopyPlane [only broken on hp]
  In file server/ddx/hp/topcat/tcCopPlan.c, routine tcCopyPlane(),
     there is a variable
       RegionPtr prgnExposed;
     at line 86.  Change this to:
       RegionPtr prgnExposed = NULL;
     Since this is set by miHandleExposures() which may not be called (line
     362).
  There is a bug with the backing store implementation (which also exists
    in R2):  CopyPlane window W1 (area A obscured) to window W2 (area B
    obscured) and area C (the intersection of A and B) will be ignored (ie
    not rendered to).  In R2 this was because miBSDoCopy() got called from
    miBSCopyPlane() (via miHandleExposures) which turned around and called
    miBSCopyPlane() to render to area C but since miBSCopyPlane() had
    set pPriv->inUse, nothing was rendered.

       	  W1                  W2                  W2
       .-------.---.       .-----------.        .-----------.
       | A     |   |   	   |           |	|           |
       |       |   |	   |  .----.   |       	|  .----.   |
       |       |   |   	   |  | B  |   |       	|  | C  |   |
       |       |   |	   |  |    |   |	|  |    |   |
       `-------'   |	   |  `----'   |	|  `----'   |
       |           |   	   |           |       	|           |
       `-----------'	   `-----------'	`-----------'

- - CopyArea [fixed]
  File: server/ddx/hp/hp/hpCopyArea.c, routine: hpcCopyArea(), line: 441.
    Change RegionPtr prgnExposed; to RegionPtr prgnExposed = NULL;
    for the same resaons as CopyPlane.
  Very likely the same window to window CopyPlane bug exists for CopyArea.

- - XY GetImage from backing store [fixed]
  This segmentation violates the server because CopyArea() writes all over
    some data structures.  The reason CopyArea() goes nuts is because its
    told to copy from a depth 8 to a depth 1.  The protocal doc sez this is
    a nono.
  Does this XY GetImage work on any server?  I don't see how from a quick
    look at the code.  Quick thoughts at a fix:  use CopyPlane() for the XY
    cases (depth times).  Use GetImage() (which is what I do in R2).
  miBSGetImage() calls miBSDoGetImage() calls CopyArea().

- - Unix domain sockets
  Still can't get these to work and am having hard time.
  Still beating on this one.
