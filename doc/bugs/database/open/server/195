### bug number:   716
### area:         server
### severity:     very high
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	AED

SYNOPSIS:
	xcalc -analog crashes the server

DESCRIPTION:
	I think this is one manifestation of some sort of memory-scribbling
	bug in the AED ddx code.  Other bizarre things I've seen on AEDs
	that might be related: several pages of output in an iconfied xterm
	puts the xterm window in a funny state in which it is partly frozen.
	Sometimes (running xconq or some Andrew programs are pretty reliable
	triggers) fonts get screwed up across the display; it looks like
	characters in the server's font info are getting scribbled on.  Using
	"xsetroot -bitmap" with full-screen bitmaps displays corrupted bitmaps,
	with some rows shifted.

	In the "xcalc -analog" case, which is the easiest way to reproduce
	the problem, the server crashes in the first XCopyArea call that xcalc
	makes.  The back trace looks like
		main
		Dispatch
		ProcCopyArea
		aedCopyArea
		aedCopyAreaFromPix
		miCopyArea
		miHandleExposures
		miRegionCreate
		Xalloc (seg-faults)

	A version of Xibm from IBM (I copied it from the Andrew people, so I
	don't know exactly what version it is) exhibits the same bug.

REPEAT-BY:
	start X; run "xcalc -analog"
