### bug number:   916
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	HP9000s320

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	HPUX 6.0

DISPLAY:
	Topcat/Renaissance

SYNOPSIS:
	When mixing display devices, any attempt to relocate the mouse in the "second" display results in 
a Server Connection #5 broken error (and the server exits...)

DESCRIPTION:
	As above. The problem is readily apparent. A couple things I would like to try but can't due to hardware
configuration are multiple topcats and >2 screens (multiple (2) Renaissance monitors does work). Possibly, a
quick fix is in the hp server code (conflict between the two since both are the first display of their type?).


REPEAT-BY:
	Start X through xinit, move mouse to second display...

FIX:
	Waiting to see if anyone else has this problem fixed...
