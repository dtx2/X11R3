                  yes - I expect this is a necessary side-effect of trying
                  to simulate a 3-button mouse with only 2.  -Ralph

UWM on the RT responds incorrectly to requests for canceling a window
manager operation.  For example, META-RIGHT-MOUSE to move a window, then
attempt to cancel the operation by clicking another mouse button.  On
the VAX, this works -- the window manager operation does not take place.
On the RT, however, the window manager operation takes place -- for
example, attempting to move the window, then clicking another button
causes the window manager operation to take place immediately (dumping
the window at the current mouse location).
