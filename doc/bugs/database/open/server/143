Subject: screen saver troubles

### bug number:   504
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	sun 3/50

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	sun 3.5

DISPLAY:
	sun 3/50

SYNOPSIS:
	screen flashes as strange times or goes blank and never comes
	back.

DESCRIPTION:

(1) When I come in in the morning and the screen is blanked, I usually
bring it back by pressing either the sun's Alternate key or the Left
or Right keys because they don't generate any output.  Then,
(sometimes) when I move the mouse the screen goes blank (black) and
nothing can get it back short of rebooting.

(2) Sometimes, just as I start to move the mouse the screen flashes,
as if the screen blanking was just going to come on but I interrupted
it by moving the mouse.  Not enough time has elapsed with no mouse or
keyboard activity for the screen blanking to have occured as expected.

Here's the output of "xset q":

Keyboard Control Values:
Key Click Volume (%): 100 
Bell Volume (%): 50 	Bell Pitch (Hz): 400 	Bell Duration (msec): 100 
Pointer (Mouse) Control Values:
Acceleration: 8 	Threshold: 8 
Screen Saver:
Prefer Blanking: Yes	Allow Exposures: Yes	Time-out: 600 	 Cycle: 600
Font Path: /usr/custom/x11/lib/fonts/

REPEAT-BY:
	Both of these problems are random.  I get around the first
	problem by bringing the screen back by moving the mouse now
	instead of pressing a key.

FIX:
	(Preferred, but not necessary)
