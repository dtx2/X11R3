DISPLAY:
    Shouldn't matter.  Monochrome frame buffer


WINDOW MANAGER:
    Shouldn't matter


AREA:
    server.


SYNOPSIS:
    Wrong information reported in the connection setup information.


DESCRIPTION:
    If you compile a server with backing store disabled, the server
    still reports that you have backing store and save-unders enabled.


REPEAT BY:
    Compile a server with backing store disabled.  Use xdpyinfo to look
    at the result...

   fix sometime next week....
