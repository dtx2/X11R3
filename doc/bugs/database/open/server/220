### bug number:   900
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	All

SYNOPSIS:
	Some cursors on AEDs seem to have black & white reversed

DESCRIPTION:
	The AED hardware has a black bitmap and a white bitmap for cursors.
	They do not directly correspond to X's mask & source bitmaps.
	aedRealizeCursor was taking X's bitmaps and stuffing them into
	the hardware directly.  It was also ignoring the foreground and
	background pixel values.

REPEAT-BY:
	Look at root window cursor on an AED.  It is white instead of black.
	xterm cursors are also reversed.  ATK cursors are not reversed.

FIX:
These diffs are on top of my previous RT fixes,
so your line numbers may vary.
