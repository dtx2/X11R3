### bug number:   1058
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

The problem is that something is too big to be assembled after passing
through the compiler:

	cc -c -O -I. -I../../include -I../../.././X11 -I../mfb
					-DCOMPRESSED_FONTS cfbbitblt.c
	Assembler:
	"/tmp/ctm004523", line 378: brw: Branch too far(41066b): try -J flag
	"/tmp/ctm004523", line 951: brw: Branch too far(38578b): try -J flag
	"/tmp/ctm004523", line 1541: brw: Branch too far(36026b): try -J flag
	"/tmp/ctm004523", line 2138: brw: Branch too far(33434b): try -J flag

'make CDEBUGFLAGS=-J cfbbitblt.o' does not help. (In fact, it generates even
more errors.)

In order to evoke this bug, I put
	#define XndxServer Xndx
in Vax.macros.
