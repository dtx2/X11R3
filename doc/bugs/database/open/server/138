VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60C

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 3.5

DISPLAY:
	CG4, BWTWO

SYNOPSIS:
	The Sun CG4 X Server does not work properly when given certain
	-dev options. X won't run on top of suntools under certain
	conditions.

DESCRIPTION:
	A note on this systems configuration: /dev/cgfour0 and
	/dev/bwtwo1 both exist. Apperantly /dev/bwtwo0 is a non-existent
	display (I've tried running adjacent suntools and NeWS desktops
	on /dev/bwtwo0 and it doesn't work, but on /dev/bwtwo1 it does,
	why? -- I don't know).

	(these cases are all standalone)

	When running xinit with no XDEVICE environment and no -dev
	option I get dual X screens (one color, one mono). No problem.

	When running xinit with -dev /dev/bwtwo1 I get this:

	  % xinit -- /usr/bin/X11/Xsun -dev /dev/bwtwo1
	  Fatal server bug!
	  Can't find any displays

	  xinit: Connection refused: Can't connect to server


	Now, when running from "suntools -8bit_color_only -toggle_enable":

	Running xinint on top of suntools:

	% overview -w xinit -- Xsun

	the screen blanks and that's it. X does indeed start but no
	where to be seen (the screen remains blank). If you move the 
	mouse to where you think your xterm is and type commands, things
	happen (you can here the disk going) and typing "exit" will
	kill X and get you back to suntools (as it should).

	With

	% overview -x xinit -- Xsun -dev /dev/bwtwo1

	same thing. Or when XDEVICE=/dev/bwtwo1.

	With

	% overview -x xinit -- Xsun -dev /dev/cgfour0

	you'll see it come up but no mouse action or keboard
	action. Hitting ^C seems to get out of this (why? I don't
	know). The following error message is generated when
	trying that: 

	  xinit: No such file or directory: signal 2
	  xinit: Not owner: can't killpg(25467, SIGHUP) for client

	  waiting for server to terminate

	What DOES work is this: start a suntools desktop on the other
	screen "suntools -d /dev/bwtwo1 -toggle_enable -s .suntools.x11",
	where ".suntools.x11" contains the line:

	overview -w xinit -- Xsun

	(this is run from a shell script that sets XDEVICE=/dev/bwtwo1).

	So you must run X on top of a suntools desktop in order to
	use it with an adjacent suntools desktop. This is acceptable
	but it should behave properly under other conditions as well.

	Also, running X on top of suntools WITHOUT -8bit_color_only
	works fine.

REPEAT-BY:
	To summarize:

	case 1: (no suntools)

	% xinit -- Xsun -dev /dev/bwtwo1

	case 2: (suntools -8bit_color_only)

	% suntools -8bit_color_only -toggle_enable
	(from a shelltool)
	% xinit -- Xsun
     or
	% xinit -- Xsun -dev /dev/bwtwo1
     or
	% xinit -- Xsun -dev /dev/cgfour0


FIX:
	Sorry, haven't touched the server code, yet....
