Subject: console idle time is impossible to get in X 11, Release 2

### bug number:   272
### area:         server
### severity:     
### assigned to:  
### status:       open
### comments:     ddx/sun

System:
	Sun 3/60 Running SunOS 3.4
Bug:
	it seems impossible to determine the console idle time from
looking at the st_mtime or st_atime fields of /dev/console, /dev/kbd
or /dev/mouse.

It seems that st_atime of /dev/kbd is constantly updated by some kind
of a polling routine. /dev/console's st_mtime field is also apparently
not being updated correctly.
