VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Microvax II

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	4.3bsd

DISPLAY:
	QDSS

SYNOPSIS: 
	Small movment of mouse cursor when I type the first character
of my user name to login.

DESCRIPTION:
	When I type the first character of my user name into the login
window, the mouse cursor moves a few pixels up and to the right.  This
only happens on the first keystroke after the login window appears.
Even pushing the shift key will do it.	

REPEAT-BY:
	Type a Ctrl-D to the login window on an idle screen (to be
sure that you get a fresh window).  Now touch the shift key while
carefully looking at the mouse cursor on the screen.  Notice that it
moved. 

My /etc/ttys file entry is this:

ttyv0	"/usr/bin/X11/xterm -fn 6x13 -geometry =80x60-10+70 -display unix:0.0  -rv -L" xterm on  secure window="/usr/bin/X11/Xqdss 0"

FIX:
