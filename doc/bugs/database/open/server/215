### bug number:   895
### area:         server
### severity:     high
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	IBM PC/RT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Mach

DISPLAY:
	Viking/AED

SYNOPSIS:
	XCopyArea from window to pixmap crashes server

DESCRIPTION:
	Trying to bring up a menu using the ITC's new menu package
	crashes the server.  It seg-faults on an adress low in segment 8,
	which indicates that the server was trying to directly read/write
	the AED display, which actually isn't accessible.

FIX:
	The problem is aedValidateGC sets up the CopyArea function
	to be mfbCopyArea if the destination is a pixmap.  If the source
	is a window, the mfb code tries to directly read the AED's bitmap.
	This quick fix just uses miCopyArea instead.  Some of the other
	assignments in aedValidateGC are suspicious, but I didn't change
	anything else.
