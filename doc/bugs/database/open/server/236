Subject: Default settings of caps-lock and control

### bug number:   963
### area:         server
### severity:     very low
### comments:     

The new Xibm code uses a PC layout by default.  This is bad, because
this means that *by default*, the "Caps Lock" key is a control key, and
the "Ctrl" key is a Caps Lock key.

Regardless of whether or not this is the preferred orientation for many,
it gives non intuitive behavior.  People who which to change things
may use xmodmap.

Patch follows:
