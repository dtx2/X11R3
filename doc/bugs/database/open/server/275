The problem:

The normal double- and triple-clicking features (to select a word or line
of text) don't seem to have any effect on the RT.

To reproduce the problem:

In an xterm or an xmh message buffer, double-click (or triple-click) the
left mouse button.  Observe that the word (or line) is not highlighted.

Suggested fix:

Unknown.
