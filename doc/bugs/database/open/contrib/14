Subject: Problem with Xr11 Imakefile: "make install" doesn't work

### bug number:   535
### area:         contrib
### severity:     low
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Sun 3/60C and Sun 3/50  

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SunOS 4.0Beta1
	SunOS 3.4

DISPLAY:
	Standard Sun monitors (using /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1 for
	the Sun 3/60C).

SYNOPSIS:
	The Imakefile for Xr11 appears to be incomplete. No install is
	actually performed when a "make install" command is executed.

DESCRIPTION:
	The Imakefile for Xr11 does not perform the install of either
	the include directory or the libXr11.a library. (It is also
	missing lint libraries.) The fix below is not very pretty or
	clean. The "InstallLibrary" was straight forward enough,
	however, the install for the contrib/Xr11/src/include/Xr11
	directory is not obvious. I also could not find any Imakefile
	rules to build a lint library given that the source exists in
	multiple subdirectories.

REPEAT-BY:
	After doing a make install in contrib/Xr11 and not finding
	either the library or the include files had been installed.

FIX:
