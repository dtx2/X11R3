Subject: emacs X-window mouse bugs

Hi, Rob--

	I can't reproduce the bug when I'm using the Sun as the
   X server-- the Apollo is definitely being implicated here.

	Cutting a zero-length piece of text from an emacs window puts
   something in the x buffer that kills any client it's pasted into.
   It doesn't matter whether the client is an xterm or emacs, or
   whether it's running on the Sun or the Apollo. 

	By zero-length text, I mean: set point using the left mouse
   button, then, without moving the mouse, press the right button.
   When the server is running on the sun, emacs puts something like a
   null string in the buffer. On the Apollo, it puts the "poison
   string." 

	I notice that xterm does something different when trying to
   cut a zero-length piece of text: It leaves the previous contents of
   the x cut buffer undisturbed. Perhaps having emacs emulate this
   behavior would work around the Apollo bug.
