VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	amiga 2000

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	amigados

DISPLAY:
	amiga

SYNOPSIS:
	uninitialized variable being used "char * display"

DESCRIPTION:
	If you do not give any parameters when starting up plaid
	it passes variable "display" to XOpenDis without initializing
	it's contents. (The variable was on the stack.) This causes
	plaid to giveup instead of use the "DISPLAY".

REPEAT-BY:
	plaid

FIX:
79c79
<     char *display = NULL;		/* correct code */
---
>     char *display;			/* old code */

Maybe I should have cut the first 5 lines off? does this bug system
look at the keywords and automatically file them, or is a human on
the other end?  Just wondering.
