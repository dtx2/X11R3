### bug number:   1044
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     
### comments:     this is a problem with the resource manager and would take
###               an addition to the Xlib spec to fix properly

Are resources not per-Screen???  It appears that they are merely
per-Display.  THIS IS A BUG! 

I am currently running an Xibm server, with two screens of different
resolution, one of which is color.  It is important that I have a set 
of resources for each screen....
