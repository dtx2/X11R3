Subject: XShrinkRegion bug (release 3) ************************
Cc: andreas%hpcvxja@sde.hp.com

### bug number:   1084
### area:         Xlib
### severity:     medium
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 3
SYNOPSIS:
	TShrinkRegion does not shrink region correctly
DESCRIPTION:
	TShrinkRegion in release 2 appears to interpret the 
	sign of the operation backwards (positive values should
	shrink the region, negative values should expand the
	region according to the Xlib manual).

	TShrinkRegion in release 3 appears to change the region
	size by twice as much as specified.
REPEAT-BY:
	Run attached program to verify that the problem exists.
SUGGESTED FIX:
	In release 2 a simple sign change works.

/** ------- test program to give go/no go on XShrinkRegion ----------- */
/*
