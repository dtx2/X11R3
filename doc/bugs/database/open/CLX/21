### bug number:   878
### area:         CLX
### severity:     low
### comments:     



I have looked through the CLX files, and I can't find the functions to use
to get the sequence number of replys and events.

On another subject, the definition of pixarray (and possibly other deftypes 
used in typep or typecase) needs to be changed to be made portable.
According to CLtL p. 46, just because an array is created with :element-type '(unsigned-byte 4)
(for example)  does not guarantee that (typep array '(array (unsigned-byte 4)))
will return non-NIL (in fact, there is no guarantee that (typep array 'pixarray)
will return non-NIL, either).
The current definition of pixarray is fine for declarations, but something like
(deftype pixarray () '(array * (* *)))
is needed in order to portably use pixarray in typep, typecase, and etypecase.
