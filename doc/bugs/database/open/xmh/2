### severity:     medium
### comments:     [bug-trackers: watch for 4 digits in bug number...]

this seems to be true for any print errors.  i had a bad command
string for the PrintCommand resource and saw the same response.

this is on both RT/PCs running AOS and uVAXes running 4.3BSD.

xmh seems to be having problems printing large files.  I selected two
rather large mail files (digests, couple hundred lines each) and hit
the Print button.  (My PrintCommand sends the mail to the X9700
printer.)  The Print button stayed on for several minutes (5?) and
then went off with no print being generated.  I assume that lpr timed
out while trying to send the files to MITVMA.  There should have been
some error window telling me this.
