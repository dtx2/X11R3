The xmh that comes with Release 6.0 has some (mis)features which I
could not find documented as changes (I could not find any
documentation of xmh changes when there are obviously some).  Thus I
assume that they might be bugs and am reporting them.

1. When entering text (composing, replying, forwarding) the input
lines are not wrapped in the window.  They appear to be wrapped before
sending and the received mail look OK.  However the lack of wrapping
in the window makes it impossible to check the mail or make changes.

2. When opening up a folder, the list of messages is reset to the
first message instead of the last as was done previously.  Since I
normally keep a lot of messages in my inbox or log folders, this makes
it harder to check the most recent entries.  I would like at least
some option to display the tail end of the group instead of the front
end.

3. Possibly a third problem is that xmh allows me to scroll past the
list of messages.  I thought that the previous version was ignore
scroll requests once it got to the last (or first) message.  I may be
wrong on this, but I don't remember scrolling past the end of the
messages prior to release 6.

If there were any new features added, I'd appreciate knowing about them.  I
did notice the longer names for the boxes (not sure that is a feature).
