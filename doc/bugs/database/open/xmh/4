### bug number:   1046
### area:         xmh
### severity:     
### comments:     text widget problems

VERSION:
    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
	Vaxstation 2000 running 4.3 BSD with LCS 5th floor additions


DISPLAY:
	Vaxstation 2000, 4 plane color (I think), using an Xserver named Xsg


WINDOW MANAGER:
	uwm


AREA: 
	Xmh  Athena version 2.0.5
			

SYNOPSIS:

	- text running off screen does not wrap around

DESCRIPTION:

	The text in the various text widget windows (compose and message
	viewing specifically) does not wrap around when it runs off of the
	edge of the text window. This might be a feature, but if it is, I 
	think it is a misfeature since I can't guarantee that messages sent 
	to me will have only 80 characters a line. This requires me to resize 
	my xmh window to the length of the longest line in the message (which 
	isn't always possible if the longest line is longer than the width of 
	my screen).

	I could demo this for you if you would like and if you don't mind
	popping up here for a minute or two (NE43-406).

REPEAT BY:
	... just running xmh. Try viewing a mail message which has an 
	excessively long line.

SAMPLE FIX:

	How about adding the wordBreak option to XtNtextOptions of all
	the text widgets used in xmh?
