### bug number:   1089
### area:         uwm
### severity:     low
### comments:     

	X11 release 3
SYNOPSIS:
	Resizing a window with a large border may not get
	the correct quadrant
DESCRIPTION:
	The border width is taken into account for the actual resizing
	and fixed point, but not in the calculations for the type of
	resizing to be done.
REPEAT-BY:
	started an xclock with a border width of 20.
	tried to resize the upper right corner by click on the upper
	right border. uwm let me resize as if I had click on the 
	upper corner, ie. I could only change the height of the clock.
	Similar problem with lower left when I clicked on the lower left
	border.
SUGGESTED FIX:
