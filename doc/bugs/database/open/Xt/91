I suppose the whole geometry thing has to go out the window (so to
speak) also, encouraging things like =200x400 anywhere is a wrong
thought (although applications like xterm take it in row/columns which
is just fine.) That needs more thinking although the answer will be
simple (one obvious solution is to go for a troff'like notion of
units, 2ix4i means 2 by 4 inches, 200px400p means 200 by 400 points
etc, basically trivia to implement, unlike the font machinery stuff
which is hard.)
