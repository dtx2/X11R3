Subject: GraphicsExpose events for Toolkit clients

### bug number:   939
### area:         Xt
### severity:     medium
### comments:     


VERSION:
    R3 from MIT


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    any


AREA:
    Xt


SYNOPSIS:
    GraphicsExposure Events are not supported by the Translation Manager.


DESCRIPTION:
    The Toolkit does not support GraphicsExposure events at all.  This is
    a difficult problem as it doesn't support events sent to non-windows
    (e.g. pixmaps) at all.


REPEAT BY:
    Obscure a portion of a Text widget and scroll text from the obscured
    area to a visible region.
