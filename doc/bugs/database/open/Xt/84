Subject:        Toolkit resource problem

### bug number:   887
### area:         Xt
### severity:     enhancement
### comments:     

VERSION:
	X11 release 2

CLIENT MACHINE:
	Bell Tech 386 AT

CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM:
	SVR3.0

DISPLAY:
	Xsight

SYNOPSIS:
	 Can't specify width or height alone

DESCRIPTION:
	 If you specify only width, then it assumes a height
	 of zero, it doesn't use the default.  This forces
	 you to specify width and height in your resource
	 data-base.  The problem seems to be in the toolkit
	 resource management routines.

REPEAT-BY:
	 In your resource data base, specify:

	 xclock*width:80

	 leave out the height specification.
	 When you run xclock, you will get a protocol error.

FIX:
	Unknown
