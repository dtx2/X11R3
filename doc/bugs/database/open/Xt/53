### bug number:   521
### area:         Xt
### severity:     low
### comments:     


VERSION:
	X11 release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	LeaveNotify events occasionally are not generated.

DESCRIPTION:
	I have a widget hierarchy which uses the Xtk focus mechanism to
        implement a traversal scheme.  When the user moves the cursor into
        the widget hierarchy, the current traversal widget highlights itself.
        When the user moves the cursor out of the widget hierarchy, the
        current traversal widget is supposed to dehighlight itself.  On
        occasion, the widget will not dehighlight itself.  I added some
        prints to XtDispatchEvent(), in an attempt to determine whether the
        toolkit was discarding these events for some reason, or whether X
        was not generating the events; it turned out that X was not generating
        these events.
