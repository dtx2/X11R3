### severity:     medium high

VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	The Xtk keyboard focus mechanism overrides X key grabs.

DESCRIPTION:
	If an application or widget sets up any XKeyGrabs, because they
        want to guarantee that they receive certain keys, they are in for
        a rude surprise if any other widgets then get set up as the Xtk
        keyboard focus.  I seem to recall that there were concerns
        expressed at the MIT toolkit meetings over how the Xtk focus
        mechanism would work with X grabs; unfortunately, they don't work
        together at all.

REPEAT-BY:
        Write an application which uses both X key grabs and 
        XtSetKeyboardFocus.
