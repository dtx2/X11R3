### bug number:   400
### area:         Xt
### severity:     medium
### comments:     


VERSION:
	Xtk release 2

SYNOPSIS:
	_XtTranslateEvent() drops enter and leave events which have a
        detail of NotifyInferior

DESCRIPTION:
	_XtTranslateEvent() contains the following bogus block of code:


            /* gross disgusting special case ||| */
            if ((event->type == EnterNotify || event->type == LeaveNotify)
                 && event->xcrossing.detail == NotifyInferior)
                 return;


        Any ideas as to why this is done???
