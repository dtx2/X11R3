    R3beta


CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:

SYNOPSIS:
    Xt needs Meta_L or Meta_R keysym in order to work properly.


DESCRIPTION:
    Widgets that use Meta in their translation tables (particular text widgets)
    will not work properly if neither Meta_L nor Meta_R appear in the keysym
    table.  Previous releases hardwired Meta to mod1.
