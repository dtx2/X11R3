Version:
	X11R2

Synopsis:
	ShellWidget should interpret width and height in a geometry
	string as multiples of the resize increment, not as pixels.

Description:
	Currently xterm is broken in that it has to manipulate the
	WM_SIZE_HINTS directly in order to define the interpretation
	of the geometry spec as above.  This is wrong, and I believe
	that this interpretation of geometry is probably the desired one
	for most applications, so I'm inclined to make the simple
	change to Shell.  It may, of course, break some users.
