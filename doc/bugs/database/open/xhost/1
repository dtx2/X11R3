Subject: duplicate entries in the access list

### bug number:   1095
### area:         xhost
### severity:     low
### comments:     

If 'xhost' is run for the same string more than once, the host ends up
in the access list duplicate times. The access list is changed infrequently
enought that the n^2 process for eliminating duplicates is probably worth
the while.

It is certainly the case that in our environment, the list is read many more
times than it is written.
