The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual that appeared here in
draft form in Releases 1 and 2 has not been approved by the X Consortium.
A revised set of conventions is under review by the Consortium for
standardization; that process is expected to conclude at the end of
November.  The final manual will be made available once it has been
approved.
