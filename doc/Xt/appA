A resource file contains text representing the default resource values for an
application or set of applications.
The resource file is an ASCII text file that consists of a number of lines
with the following EBNF syntax:
.TS
l l .
resourcefile	= {line "\\\\n"}.
line	= (comment | production).
comment	= "!" string.
production	= resourcename ":" string.
resourcename	= ["*"] name {("." | "*") name}.
string	= {<any character not including eol>}.
name	= {"A"-"Z" | "a"-"z" | "0"-"9"}.

If the last character on a line is a backslash (\\),
that line is assumed to continue on the next line.
