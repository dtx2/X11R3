The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  support for hpux and macII has been integrated into the generic
	4.2bsd library.
     o  bsd emulation routines (e.g. bcopy, bzero, etc. have been moved into
	a new bsdemul library).
     o  the sysV directory has been removed since it really wasn't System 5.
