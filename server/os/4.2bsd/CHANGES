The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  new OS routine CloseDownWellKnownSockets added.
     o  new font naming scheme that separates font names from file names.
     o  support for multiple font formats (SNF, BDF, compressed, etc.)
     o  hpux and macII support integrated into generic 4.2bsd.
     o  support for delayed and non-blocking writes added.
     o  access control now gets restored on server reset.
     o  DECnet object name changed as per Digital standards.
     o  bugs in wildcard matching have been fixed.
     o  huge input buffers are periodically shrunk.
     o  font names and color names are now case insensative; lowercasing for
	ISO Latin 1 names is done properly.
