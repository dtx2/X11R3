	Sun X11 drivers -  25 February 1988

A joint production of:

	Adam de Boor		University of California,  Berkeley

	David Rosenthal
	Stuart Marks
	Robin Schaufler
	Mike Schwartz
	Frances Ho
	Geoff Lee
	Mark Opperman		Sun Microsystems

This version of the Sun X.11 drivers uses ../mi,  ../mfb and ../cfb to support
the following configurations:

	Sun/2		bw2	cg2/3/5
	Sun/3		bw2	cg2/3/4/5
	Sun/4		bw2	cg2/4
	Sun/386i	mono	color

The following configurations are NOT supported:

	Sun/1		bw1	cg1	(requires separate port)
	Sun/2			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/3			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/4			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)

The drivers are completely untuned, and have inferior performance.  The code
is lint-free.  It installs and runs on these configurations under SunOS 3.2,
3.4, and 4.0.  However, we must stress that it is completely unsupported, and
if you have problems installing or using it you are on your own.

Things to check before building:

1)	util/imake.includes/Sun.macros - set the SunOSMajorVersion and
	SunOSMinorVersion parameters to the right values.

2)	util/imake.includes/Imake.tmpl - check LIBDIR, FONTDIR, etc.

3)	Make sure the fonts/Makefile uses the pad flag on the font
	compiler to pad the glyphs to 4-byte boundaries.

4)	If you want the non-portable zoids extension, add -DZOIDS to CFLAGS.
	The non-portable zoids have worse performance than portable zoids
	but prove that the extension mechanism works for output.


Then build the system by:

1)	Go for it.  In the top-level directory, type

	make World

	This takes about forty minutes on a 4/260, and somewhat longer
	on other Suns.

2)	Go for it.  In the top-level directory, type

	make install

	Otherwise, you'll want to create a bunch of symbolic links to
	the various executables and data files scattered throughout
	the hierarchy.

3)	Exit suntools or whatever other window system you use.

4)	On the console, or from an rlogin connection, put whatever you
	chose for BINDIR (in Imake.tmpl) in your search path, and then
	start the server:

	    xinit
	or
	    xinit -- -dev /dev/??? [see below]

	If it's from the console,  you probably want to redirect the
	output thus:

	    xinit >& /tmp/x11.out

5)	xinit should start up an xterm window that acts as a console.  When
	this xterm terminates, the xinit will kill the server.  You can also
	start up client programs from a terminal or rlogin, but you must
	first set the DISPLAY environment variable:

	    setenv DISPLAY unix:0
	    xterm &


6)	In general,  Xsun auto-configures to use all the available
	framebuffers.  In some circumstances,  you may need to use a
	-dev argument on the command line to prevent this:

	3/110LC, 3/110C, 3/60C 

	If you want to use color, use "xinit -- -dev /dev/cgfour0".
	If you want to use monochrome, use "xinit -- -dev /dev/bwtwo0".
		
	GP, GP+, GP2

	If you have one of these GP's installed, use 

	    xinit -- -dev /dev/cgtwo0

7)	To shut the server down,  hit  it with a Hangup or Terminate signal.

8)	Xsun coexists with the SunWindows environment.  If you run Xsun
	from a shell window under suntools, then Xsun will overlay that
	desktop.  If you have two desktops, then 'adjacentscreens' will still
	be in effect.  You may want to redirect the output of the server to a
	window that is visible on another desktop.

9)	If X crashes, it will leave the keyboard in a funny state.  There is a
	program called "kbd_mode" that will reset the mode of the keyboard.
	"kbd_mode -a" is the appropriate setting for the bare console, and
	"kbd_mode -e" is the appropriate setting for running with SunWindows.
	You may have to issue this command from a terminal or from an rlogin
	connection.  If you run from the bare console, you can give the
	command

	xinit ; kbd_mode -a

	so that the keyboard mode will ALWAYS be set properly when the server
	terminates.  The kbd_mode program is in the server/ddx/sun directory.
