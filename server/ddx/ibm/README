Remember to...
...make sure that HCRevision is correctly defined (see Rt.macros for details).

NOTES:
mfbbitblt.c takes a *long* time to compile -O with hc version 2.1 on machines
with 4-meg or less of memory.   Wait it out or compile mfbbitblt by hand
without -O.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Couldn't have made it without the help of John Kubiatowicz, Bob Mckie, 
Paul Shupak, and Jeff Weinstein.  Thanks guys.

Thanks to Keith and Jim for your patience...

At the last minute, some critical server bugs were discovered in the apa16
driver, and Erik Fortune is busily fixing them even as I type.  Please send
flames and requests for patches to him at:
