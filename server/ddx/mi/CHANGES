The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  New and improved wide line, wide arc and filled arc code.
	All but filled arcs should now conform to the protocol.  Mostly now
        slower.
     o  New interface to CopyArea/CopyPlane integrated info mibitblt.c,
	other bugs in CopyArea/CopyPlane fixed.
     o  Machine independent version of Backing Store implemented.  This
	also caused some interface changes with DIX, so be cautious.
     o  miPaintWindow optimized to eliminate GC allocation and reverification.
	This is still a good candidate for replacement in the device library,
	as the amount of extra work here is still large in some cases.
     o  new routine miSendGraphicsExpose which should be placed in
	pScreen->SendGraphicsExpose.  This conforms to the new
	CopyArea/CopyPlane interface.
     o  new file miinitext.c -- InitExtensions now lives in the DDX and
	this file is used by several devices which don't have special hardware.
     o  new hook in miValidateTree.  call miClipNotify with a function
	to be called whenever the clipList for a window changes.  Parallax
	uses this function to update a mask plane on the screen to select
	video windows.
     o  Various bugs in CopyPlane, GetImage, PutImage, and stippling fixed.
