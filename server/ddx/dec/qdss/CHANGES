The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  putImage has been mostly rewritten.  It's almost working.
     o  backing store support using mi.  Currently the SaveAreas function
	is very slow and needs to be rewritten.
     o  huge stipple/tile troubles partially fixed.
     o  support for Ultrix 3.0.  New driver reports 32 bits of time in ms.
     o  mouse movement compression.  Previous server reported multiple
	consecutive mouse motion events, now reports only the last.
	Lacking a motion buffer, this is not a perfect fix.
     o  planemasks fixed on some operations.
