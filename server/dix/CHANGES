The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  fix AllocColorPlanes to allow allocation of all planes at once
     o  pGC->CopyArea/CopyPlane now return RegionPtr, DIX now calls
	new pWindow->SendGraphicsExpose with this region to dispatch
	GrapicsExposure events.
     o  QueryFont now returns font Ink metrics correctly now.  Ink metrics
	are an additional element of the DIX font structure which must
	be set up by the font loader
     o  Obeys Length restriction for client connections.
     o  CopyGC now has an error return to indicate whether bits
	outside the set of valid GC change bits were set -- this
	now generates a Value error.  Many other specious requests
	also generate Value errors now.
     o  CopyPlane checks it's bit-plane argument for legality
     o  Delayed/Buffered writes for client events implemented,
	which required minor DIX changes.
     o  GetImage checks pWindow->viewable
     o  SelectionClear now sent to selection owner, not window creator
     o  new utility function in dixutils.c CopyISOLatin1Lowered to
	convert mixed case Latin1 strings to lower case.  Used by
	the font routines and by the color-name lookup routines.
     o  bug with keysym map width fixed
     o  many bugs with cursor reference counts in grabs fixed
     o  DIX save under support.  This code supplies save unders to
	any DDX which advertises backing store but not save unders.
     o  mixing window gravity and bit gravity fixed.
     o  a host of minor bugs fixed
