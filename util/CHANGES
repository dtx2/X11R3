The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  lndir.sh has been changed slightly so that it doesn't cause some
	Bourne shells to dump core.
     o  a new utility, checkfn, has been added for checking filenames for
	portability; it is generally only used to create distribution kits
	and is not built by default.
     o  a new install script, lninst.sh, has been added to do fake
	installs by creating symlinks; this is useful for development
	organizations.
     o  a copy of the public domain C preprocessor written by Martin Minow
	has been included for systems that can't handle abusive numbers of
	compiler variables and huge macros.
     o  a emulation of the soelim program has been provided for machines that
        need have it.
     o  the rgb database and program has been into a top-level directory.
     o  mkdirhier.sh script added for creating directory trees.
     o  various scripts moved into a scripts directory.
     o  sources to (un)compress included courtesy of UC Berkeley.
