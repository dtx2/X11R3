     This file contains instructions on how to make CLX work with Franz
Common Lisp.  CLX should work on any machine that supports Allegro Common
Lisp version 3.0.1.  It also works under ExCL version 2.0 on the Vax.
However, it has only been tested extensively using version 3.0.1 on Sun3's
and Sun4's.


     There are three steps to compile and install CLX.  The first is simply
moving files around.

In this directory, execute (assuming you using csh):

% mkdir MIT
% mv defsystem.cl MIT
% mv excldefsys.cl defsystem.cl
% mv exclMakefile Makefile

This next is only necessary if you are using ExCL 2.0 on the Vax:

% foreach i (*.lisp)
? mv $i $i:r.cl
? end

     The second is compiling the source files into fasl files.  The fasl files
will be combined into one big fasl file, CLX.fasl.  This file is then installed
in your Common Lisp library directory in the next step.

% make

     Now you must move the CLX.fasl file into the standard CL library.
This is normally "/usr/local/lib/cl/code", but you can find out for sure
by typing:

<cl> (directory-namestring excl::*library-code-pathname*)

to a running Lisp.  If it prints something other than "/usr/local/lib/cl/code"
substitute what it prints in the below instructions.

% mv CLX.fasl /usr/local/lib/cl/code/clx.fasl
% mv *.o /usr/local/lib/cl/code

Now you can just start up Lisp and type:

<cl> (load "clx")

to load in CLX.  You may want to dump a lisp at this point since CLX is a large
package and can take some time to load into Lisp.


     Sophisticated users may wish to peruse the Makefile and defsystem.cl
and note how things are set up.  For example we
hardwire the compiler interrupt check switch on, so that CL can still be 
interrupted while it is reading from the X11 socket.  Please see chapter 7
of the CL User's guide for more information on compiler switches and their
effects.

     Also, if you make changes to parts of the CLX package and want to rebuild
the CLX binary, you should either (1) remove all the .fasl files from the clx
directory and rebuild the binary from scratch or (2) compile the changed
modules using the CLX binary and then use "make" to create a new CLX.fasl file,
which should then be moved to the library directory.
