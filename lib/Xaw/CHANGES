The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o	the Athena widgets now use the R3 Intrinsics.
     o	many resources that the documentation said were ints are
	really Dimensions and/or Positions.  See Xt/CHANGES for
	the impact of this.
     o	some resources that were formerly ints are now Dimensions.
	The documentation and header files should now match reality.
     o	the header file Misc.h has been renamed to XawMisc.h.
     o	Label and Command have two additional resources; XtNresize
	to disable resize requests in SetValues and XtNbitmap
	to display a pixmap in place of the text.
     o	Label and Command now support XtQueryGeometry.
     o	Label, Command, and other subclasses of Simple will now display
	their insensitive border in the foreground color rather than
	always using white.
     o	Box now returns a correct preferred geometry when first realized.
     o	Form and Viewport now respect any initial non-zero width or
	height specified for them when they are created.
     o	Form now registers StringToWidget and StringToEdgeType conversion
	procedures so that layouts can be specified externally in
	a resource file.
     o	Form supports the new XtCWQueryOnly flag in geometry requests
     o	Scrollbar does color and reverse video properly.  SetValues on
	an unrealized Scrollbar now works better.
     o	Scroll has a new callback, XtNjumpProc, which is called under
	the same conditions as XtNthumbProc but the call_data argument
	is a float* to allow portable applications to be written.
     o	AsciiSink (used by AsciiDisk and AsciiString) has been
	fixed to not do a bad left-bearing computation and to get
	the correct foreground.
     o	Text, AsciiString, and AsciiDisk now get the correct background
	resource.
     o	Several key bindings in Text that were broken now work.
     o	Several scrolling and positioning bugs in Text were fixed.
     o	Text should now do wordWrap correctly.
     o	Selection support has been added to Text.  Minimal support is
	provided for all sources/sinks but sources can provide additional
	support through new methods in the TextSource structure.  Any
	private text sources and sinks will have to be updated to
	initialize these new methods (NULL is fine).
     o	Text*.h files have been re-organized to make public declarations
	public, sink/source declarations semi-public and everything else
	private (to subclasses).  New header TextSrcP.h contains
	declarations needed by sources and sinks without exposing the
	entire internals of TextP.h.
     o	Clock now handles exposures without causing its interval timer to
	close to zero.
     o	Load now uses resource XtNhighlight to specify the label and scale
	color.  It also updates more intelligently and scales correctly.
     o	Extra spaces in Text have been removed to make it work on compilers
	with small internal table space.
     o	Grip has a cursor resource and determines its color from the
	XtNforeground resource rather than XtNbackground.
     o	the Mailbox widget has a new resource to specify a shell
	command to be executed to check for new mail.  It also now
	uses the translation manager and no longer compresses its
	interval timer to zero on exposures or button presses.
     o	Mailbox has two new resources: XtNvolume and XtNonceOnly to
	provide better noise control.
     o	XtNforceBars in Viewport no longer dumps core.
     o	VPaned no longer assumes all it's children are
	mapped_when_managed.  It no longer grabs the mouse when
	resizing a pane.  It handles resize requests from children better.
     o	a new routine, XtSimpleStippledPixmap, has been added.
	(documentation not yet written).
     o	a new widget, List, has been added.
     o	Lots of resource and memory leaks due to missing Destroy methods
	have been repaired.
     o	New files Template.h, TemplateP.h and Template.c (all installed
	in INCDIR) have been added to simplify new widget construction.
     o	A VendorShell has been added to Xaw to register StringToPixmap
	conversion for icon pixmaps.
