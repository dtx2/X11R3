The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  XMisc.c has been added; it contains several routines for accessing
	opaque information and was adopted in June.
     o  Xlib now runs on the Cray and should be much easier to port to 
       	non-32bit architectures.  As a result, several new mechanisms 
	have been added:
	     -  new ifdef MUSTCOPY for machines that need to copy data in and
		out of network buffers instead of referencing. 
	     -  new SIZEOF macro and lots of sizeof_ symbolic constants for 
		computing size of protocol structures.
	     -  new NEXTPTR macro for finding address of data following a
		typed pointer; returns a (char *) on MUSTCOPY machines and
		(type *) on direct dereference machines.
	     -  new Data16, _XRead16, _XRead16Pad, Data32, and _XRead32
		for converting arrays of shorts and longs to and from
		INT16 and INT32.
	     -  new macro OneDataCard32 for inserting a single data word.
	     -  new STARTITERATE and ENDITERATE for walking network buffer.
     o  The routines XChangeProperty and XGetWindowProperty now take care of
	converting arrays of chars, shorts, and longs to and from INT8, 
	INT16, and INT32.
     o  The XCheck*Event routines and _XReadEvents have been changed to only
	flush if they are about to block.
     o  An experimental implementation of the ICCCM pseudoroots has been
	provided for prototyping rooms or debugging nested window managers.
	HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PART OF THE XLIB SPECIFICATION AND IS SUBJECT TO 
	CHANGE OR REMOVAL WITHOUT NOTICE.  See the client "pseudoroot".
     o  Untested support for Mips computers has been contributed.
     o  Graphics Contexts cache flushing improved.
     o  Signed network protocol objects (e.g. INT8, INT16, and INT32 within
	an xSomething structure) now are extracted using the cvt macros in
	X11/Xmd.h because bitfields are not guaranteed to honor signs.
     o  preprocessor lines of the form #endif FOO have been changed to 
	#endif /* FOO */ according to spec.
     o  XGetWindowProperties always mallocs space for its return data even if
	the data has zero elements, to match the Xlib manual.
     o  XLookupString now has list of key bindings per display, can cope with
	mod map changes, handles up and down case of all Latin-1, doesn't
	convert non-Latin-1 keysyms, understand Control 2-8 and /, and use
	prefered protocol definition for CapsLock.
     o  fixed memory leaks from not freeing vendor name or event queue list.
     o  make XPutImage handle nibble shifting.
     o  better region code, including fix for overflow on complex regions.
     o  made SendEvent subevent structure be a byte array on MUSTCOPY machines
	because the protocol request wasn't quadaligned.
     o  XrmPutfileDatabase will write file with proper special char quoting.
     o  fixed cursor font caching.
